## Subscribing to Newsletter

At this time I'm not interested in creating a subscribe function through the honeypots known as email marketing services. Since several of them censor / block certain topics, including Bitcoin-related content, they wouldn't be very interested in me either anyway. Here are a few ways you can be notified about new editions:

1. Follow me and / or this repository on GitHub. When a new edition comes out, I will link to it here in the readme. However, if you use this option, be aware that you may also be seeing all the changes I make throughout the month in your feed.
2. Bookmark and / or subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/feed.xml).
3. Follow and turn on the notification bell for [Panopticast](https://twitter.com/Panopticast). This account is not being used to post podcast episodes yet, so I will be using it to share newsletters for the time being. You could also be notified through my Twitter account, but obviously I post / share a lot of other content there as well.
4. Join the Keybase team "[tmibp_newsletter](https://keybase.io/team/tmibp_newsletter)." It is open to anyone, and there is a chat room to comment or ask questions. If you engage in the chat, please be mindful of people's attention and only post messages related to the newsletter. If you want to ask me a question or send a tip, you can message me directly.
5. If you do prefer to be notified about the newsletter by email, send me your email address privately and I will add you to a BCC list. I will only send you one email per month, with a brief greeting and a link to the newsletter. You can 'unsubscribe' at any time. Should I ever end up integrating some kind of privacy-respecting email marketing service in the future, I will not migrate your email address without your explicit permission.

## February 1st - FINCEN PROPOSED RULEMAKING UPDATE

In [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all) and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/), I've followed the proposed rulemaking from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regarding personal and financial information of cryptocurrency users. On February 1st, [Jerry Brito](https://www.coincenter.org/people/jerry-brito/), and [Peter van Valkenburgh](https://www.coincenter.org/people/peter-van-valkenburgh/) from **Coin Center** gave an update in [episode #25](https://coincenter.simplecast.com/episodes/defi-and-the-sec) of their [Tangents](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1356320598306205696) podcast.

## February 2nd - TAPROOT ACTIVATION MEETINGS

In [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-14th---bitcoin-core-v021-released), I covered the release of [Bitcoin Core v0.21](https://twitter.com/bitcoincoreorg/status/1349720304680054784), which included "the proposed Taproot consensus rules ([BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki) and [BIP342](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki))." Adam Gibson and [Kristaps Kaupe](https://bitcoinhackers.org/@kristapsk) performed "[the first joinmarket coinjoin on signet](https://x0f.org/@waxwing/105656018148146093)," which was recently supported in [Bitcoin Core v0.21](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2021-January/000097.html). On February 2nd, with almost 90% of [global hashrate](https://taprootactivation.com/) loosely signalling support for Taproot, there was an IRC meeting to discuss activation methods on mainnet.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Taproot_activation_proposals) currently details six distinct variations of activation. For the most part, those who participated in the chat voted for BIP-8 (false, 1y), which will "[provide eventual flag day activation after a reasonable time (recommended a year), as well as for accelerated activation by majority of hash rate before the flag date](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki)." During the meeting, pull-requests [#1020](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1020) and [#1021](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1021) on the BIP-8 specification were merged.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The next day, [**CoinDesk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1357016354809925633) journalist [Colin Harper](https://twitter.com/AsILayHodling) [covered](https://www.coindesk.com/taproot-bitcoin-upgrade-improve-technology-software) Taproot, MuSig2, CoinSwap, and point time lock contracts (PTLCs), which I've highlighted in [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-4th---hrf-grants-to-joininbox-zeus-fully-noded). [Folkson](https://bitcoinhackers.org/@michaelfolkson) shared [a summary of the meeting](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018379.html) to the mailing list. He soon provided an outline of the various arguments, with [comments from Greg Maxwell](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lcjhl6/taproot_activation_pools_will_be_able_to_veto/gm2l02w/), and [announced](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018380.html) the scheduling of [another meeting](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018425.html) on February 16th.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Yesterday (February 16th) we held a second meeting on Taproot activation on IRC which again was open to all. Despite what appeared to be majority support for LOT=false over LOT=true in the first meeting I (and others) thought the arguments had not been explored in depth and that we should have a follow up meeting almost entirely focused on whether LOT (lockinontimeout) should be set to true or false.

[Harper](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1362131880942964747) summarised [key points](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-taproot-upgrade-july-finer-details-not-finalized) of the second meeting. '[ZmnSCPxj](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018430.html),' [Matt Corallo](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018433.html), [Adam Back](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018447.html), [Anthony Towns](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018460.html), [Jeremy Rubin](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018469.html) and others participated in follow-up discussion.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> the code for the fully primed-and-ready Taproot upgrade will be deployed sometime between March 17 and March 31 (or April if necessary), but the actual signaling that kick-starts the activation process probably won’t start until July.

## February 6th - JOIN THE WASABIKAS

[**Wasabi**](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1358083033941897220) has launched a new podcast, hosted by [Max Hillebrand](https://twitter.com/HillebrandMax/status/1358050184228442120), titled "[Join the Wasabikas - a Bitcoin Privacy Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPwc75tPMdsixsuhwau82Q0IfxECo0z_E)." A short [pilot episode](https://anchor.fm/wasabikas/episodes/0-0-Max-Hillebrand-welcomes-you-to-Join-the-Wasabikas---a-Bitcoin-Privacy-Podcast-eq0e93) was released on February 6th. "[The History of Wasabi Wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1i560q08JE)," "[From Empty Page to WabiSabi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQEftpq-m4Q)," and "[Nicholas Dorier Is Making Banks Obsolete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJLlGbhe-aM)" were published throughout the month.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On February 18th, they also [published](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-research-experience/) a note about the weekly [Wasabi Research Club](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WasabiResearchExperience), which has become a relaxed [virtual meeting place](https://meet.jit.si/wasabiresearch) for anyone to engage in "meaningful discussions on bitcoin privacy." The club convenes every Monday at 18:00 UTC.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## February 8th - SIM SWAPPING CONSPIRACY CHARGES

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-2nd---coinsquare-data-breach) and [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-21st---the-solution-to-sim-swapping), I have covered the threat of SIM swapping for bitcoiners who use phones for mobile wallets and / or as a second factor on their accounts. On February 8th, the [U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern District of Louisiana](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/pr/former-phone-company-employee-charged-rolein-sim-swap-scam-targeted-least-19-customers) announced that they were [charging a former sales representative of a phone company](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/press-release/file/1365551/download) with "conspiracy to commit wire fraud" as a result of "his role in a SIM Swap scam that targeted at least nineteen people" and "cryptocurrency belonging to the customers." According to the charges:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> On or about November 10, 2018, Victim A's telephone number was swapped to a SIM card contained in an Apple iPhone 8 bearing International Mobile Equipment Identity number 356703087816582 ("the Apple iPhone 8") that was in the possession of Richard Li. The SIM Swap of Victim A caused, among other things, the transmission of a series of writings, signs, signals, and sounds that traveled in interstate commerce, including between the States of Florida, Louisiana, and California. As a result of the SIM Swap, Victim A's email accounts and Binance, Bittrex, Coinbase, Gemini, Poloniex, ItBit, and Neo Wallet crypto currency accounts were compromised without Victim A's knowledge or authorization. Victim A suffered an actual loss of a substantial portion of his cryptocurrency.

:warning: If you were impacted or vulnerable to this type of breach, I recommend Kraken's "[Security Advisory: Mobile Phones](https://blog.kraken.com/post/219/security-advisory-mobile-phones/)," Lopp's "[A Home Defense Primer](https://blog.keys.casa/a-home-defense-primer/)," "[A Modest Privacy Protection Proposal](https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/)," and Bazzell's "[Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/200-stalking-doxing-and-online-harassment/id1165843330?i=1000504074121)."

## February 9th - FOURTH AMENDMENT LAWSUIT AGAINST IRS UPDATE

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-15th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs), I had highlighted [Jim Harper](https://twitter.com/Jim_Harper/status/1283448554099482632)'s lawsuit against the IRS "for violation of my Fourth Amendment and Due Process rights" in relation to the sharing of his financial data by a third party service. On February 9th, [**CoinDesk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1359213111706849284) privacy reporter [Benjamin Powers](https://twitter.com/benjaminopowers/status/1359232013895663617) had published [an article](https://www.coindesk.com/lawsuit-irs-expand-privacy-for-crypto-users) summarising [the government's recent response](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nhd.54425/gov.uscourts.nhd.54425.16.0.pdf) and the case up to this point.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Harper said because he’s active in this area of policy, he knows the law is bad. 
>
> “The ‘third-party doctrine’ says that people who have shared personal information with a service provider like Coinbase no longer have a Fourth Amendment interest in the information,” he said. “The third-party doctrine is the death knell of privacy because of the way we use network technology today in every aspect of our lives. Either the third-party doctrine or privacy is going to go away. I hope this case tees up reconsideration of the third-party doctrine in the Supreme Court.”

He also pointed to an older news release from July 2019, in which IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig stated that they were "[expanding our efforts involving virtual currency, including increased use of data analytics](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-has-begun-sending-letters-to-virtual-currency-owners-advising-them-to-pay-back-taxes-file-amended-returns-part-of-agencys-larger-efforts)." This corresponds with their ongoing inquiries that I've explored in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea), [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#june-30th---irs-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins-lightning), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-4th---irs-still-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins), and [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-2nd---tax-authorities-demand-disclosures).

## February 15th - NEW BIP47 DRAFT AND PAYNYM TORCH

Justus Ranvier published a draft for "[Reusable Payment Codes for Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets, version 3](https://github.com/justusranvier/obpp-rfc/blob/bip47/obpp-05.mediawiki)," which extends his prior [BIP-47](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) specification from 2015. The proposal recommends using [BIP-157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki) client-side filtering with [OBPP-4 Enhanced Selectivity filters](https://github.com/justusranvier/obpp-rfc/blob/bip47/obpp-04.mediawiki) for detecting notification transactions. Currently, the only wallet which implements these [Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) stealth addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ECDH_address) is [**Samourai Wallet**](https://samouraiwallet.com/bips), which recently [celebrated its sixth-year anniversary](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1359087712129712130). I have previously covered [PayNyms](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1361399254594572290) in [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-20th---dirtcoin-diaries-paynym-torch) and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-30th---introducing-soroban).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-20th---dirtcoin-diaries-paynym-torch), I featured the PayNym torch event, inspired by the 2019 Lightning torch event. On February 22nd, '[EconoAlchemist](https://twitter.com/econoalchemist)' published [an article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/using-stowaway-a-privacy-enhancing-tool-from-samourai-wallet) in [**Bitcoin Magazine**](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1363925811040976904) about an upcoming torch event, organised by the same [Bitcoin Enemies](https://bitcoinenemies.com/) virtual meetup group, using various **Samourai Wallet** features like [Stowaway](https://samouraiwallet.com/stowaway) and Soroban (see [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-30th---introducing-soroban)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> There is growing interest from the Bitcoin community in privacy enhancing tools like Stowaway, PayNyms and BIP 47. On February 28, 2021, a group of Bitcoin privacy advocates launched operation [#GretasFury](https://bitcoinenemies.com/gretas-fury/). Designed to interrupt common input ownership heuristics by passing a payment torch of 1 sat transactions using Stowaway, operation [#GretasFury](https://bitcoinenemies.com/gretas-fury/) brought together dozens of users from around the world. Each collaborator anonymously participated in the torch passes by using their PayNyms. Each Stowaway transaction that was made utilized Soroban communications over Tor. Participants managed the timing of their transaction with out-of-band communications over applications like [Telegram](https://t.me/tx_tricks) and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#tx_tricks:bitcoinenemies.com?via=bitcoinenemies.com).

Graphic designer [**@artdesignbySF**](https://twitter.com/artdesignbySF/status/1363938123143667716), who also helped with the [BTCPay server integration](https://hrf.org/donate-bitcoin/) for the **Human Rights Foundation** (HRF), contributed an animated graphic for [a new short video](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1363750841300250624) [demonstrating these tools](https://youtu.be/M1rf2jIVKiQ).

## February 17th - TELEPORT TRANSACTIONS: A COINSWAP IMPLEMENTATION

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-11th---design-sketch-for-first-version-of-coinswap), and [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-8th---coinswap-on-testnet), I have followed [Chris Belcher](https://twitter.com/chris_belcher_/status/1362168844341633029)'s development of a working CoinSwap protocol. He has since demonstrated "[a 5-hop CoinSwap on testnet](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018426.html)" using the existing implementation, and written about [why fungibility is important](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lm6nmk/another_coinswap_milestone_multihop_coinswaps/gowzcpp/) in a variety of situations, quoting from [Maxwell's 2013 post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3588908#msg3588908) on the subject.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The project is still a work in progress. All kinds of attacks are possible right now, so it shouldn't be used on mainnet with real money yet. Also right now the CoinSwap addresses created by the project appear as 2-of-2 multisignature addresses, but the plan is to use ECDSA-2P which will make them look the same as regular single-signature addresses which is needed before the thing massively improves privacy and fungibility.

## February 26th - THE NYM NETWORK WHITEPAPER

In [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-10th---nym-mixnet-test-rewards-in-bitcoin) and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-10th---state-of-the-onion-and-nym), I highlighted the development of the Nym mixnet, which is testing the use of bitcoin as a reward system. This month, [associate professor](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~cdiaz/) [Claudia Diaz](https://twitter.com/claudsdayz), [Harry Halpin](https://twitter.com/harryhalpin/status/1365341758654189576), and [Aggelos Kiayias](https://twitter.com/sol3gga) from [**Nym Technologies**](https://twitter.com/nymproject/status/1365340929469652992) published [a whitepaper](https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf) outlining how it can "serve as the foundation for a vast range of privacy-enhanced applications that defend the fundamental freedoms of people across the globe against traffic analysis by powerful adversaries."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Incentives work. Bitcoin has demonstrated this. One fundamental premise of Nym is that well-designed incentives can sustain a large-scale privacy infrastructure as a collective public good. This challenges the status quo, making possible a new generation of services and applications that offer privacy as a feature rather than indiscriminately amassing user data. In Nym, incentives ensure that those who provision the core infrastructure are rewarded for their work. A market model for node operators, in contrast to volunteerdriven models, makes it possible for the Nym network to arbitrarily scale up to meet increased demand as the user base grows.

## February 2nd - TAPROOT ACTIVATION MEETING

In [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-14th---bitcoin-core-v021-released), I covered the release of [Bitcoin Core v0.21](https://twitter.com/bitcoincoreorg/status/1349720304680054784), which included "the proposed Taproot consensus rules ([BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki) and [BIP342](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki))." On February 2nd, with almost 90% of [global hashrate](https://taprootactivation.com/) loosely signalling support for Taproot, there was an IRC meeting to discuss activation methods on mainnet.

The [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Taproot_activation_proposals) currently details six distinct variations of activation. For the most part, those who participated in the chat voted for BIP-8 (false, 1y), which will "[provide eventual flag day activation after a reasonable time (recommended a year), as well as for accelerated activation by majority of hash rate before the flag date. ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki)." During the meeting, pull-requests [#1020](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1020) and [#1021](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1021) on the BIP-8 specification were merged.

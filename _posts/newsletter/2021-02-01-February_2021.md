## February 2nd - TAPROOT ACTIVATION MEETING

In [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-14th---bitcoin-core-v021-released), I covered the release of [Bitcoin Core v0.21](https://twitter.com/bitcoincoreorg/status/1349720304680054784), which included "the proposed Taproot consensus rules ([BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki) and [BIP342](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki))." On February 2nd, with almost 90% of [global hashrate](https://taprootactivation.com/) loosely signalling support for Taproot, there was an IRC meeting to discuss activation methods on mainnet.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Taproot_activation_proposals) currently details six distinct variations of activation. For the most part, those who participated in the chat voted for BIP-8 (false, 1y), which will "[provide eventual flag day activation after a reasonable time (recommended a year), as well as for accelerated activation by majority of hash rate before the flag date](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki)." During the meeting, pull-requests [#1020](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1020) and [#1021](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1021) on the BIP-8 specification were merged.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The next day, [**CoinDesk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1357016354809925633) journalist [Colin Harper](https://twitter.com/AsILayHodling) [covered](https://www.coindesk.com/taproot-bitcoin-upgrade-improve-technology-software) Taproot, MuSig2, CoinSwap, and point time lock contracts (PTLCs), which I've highlighted in [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-4th---hrf-grants-to-joininbox-zeus-fully-noded). [Folkson](https://bitcoinhackers.org/@michaelfolkson) shared [a summary of the meeting](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018379.html) to the mailing list. He soon provided an outline of the various arguments, with [comments from Greg Maxwell](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lcjhl6/taproot_activation_pools_will_be_able_to_veto/gm2l02w/), and [announced](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018380.html) the scheduling of a follow-up meeting on February 16th.

## February 8th - SIM SWAPPING CONSPIRACY CHARGES

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-2nd---coinsquare-data-breach) and [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-21st---the-solution-to-sim-swapping), I have covered the threat of SIM swapping for bitcoiners who use phones for mobile wallets and / or as a second factor on their accounts. On February 8th, the [U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern District of Louisiana](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/pr/former-phone-company-employee-charged-rolein-sim-swap-scam-targeted-least-19-customers) announced that they were [charging a former sales representative of a phone company](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/press-release/file/1365551/download) with "conspiracy to commit wire fraud" as a result of "his role in a SIM Swap scam that targeted at least nineteen people" and "cryptocurrency belonging to the customers." According to the charges:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> 20. On or about November 10, 2018, Victim A's telephone number was swapped to a SIM card contained in an Apple iPhone 8 bearing International Mobile Equipment Identity number 356703087816582 ("the Apple iPhone 8") that was in the possession of Richard Li. The SIM Swap of Victim A caused, among other things, the transmission of a series of writings, signs, signals, and sounds that traveled in interstate commerce, including between the States of Florida, Louisiana, and California. As a result of the SIM Swap, Victim A's email accounts and Binance, Bittrex, Coinbase, Gemini, Poloniex, ItBit, and Neo Wallet crypto currency accounts were compromised without Victim A's knowledge or authorization. Victim A suffered an actual loss of a substantial portion of his cryptocurrency.

:warning: If you were impacted or vulnerable to this type of breach, I recommend Kraken's "[Security Advisory: Mobile Phones](https://blog.kraken.com/post/219/security-advisory-mobile-phones/)," Lopp's "[A Home Defense Primer](https://blog.keys.casa/a-home-defense-primer/)," "[A Modest Privacy Protection Proposal](https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/)," and Bazzell's "[Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/200-stalking-doxing-and-online-harassment/id1165843330?i=1000504074121)."

## February 9th - BITCOIN FOR EVERYBODY ONLINE COURSE

Podcaster [Stephan Livera](https://twitter.com/stephanlivera/status/1359229695389126657) announced the launch of a new free online course, "[Bitcoin for Everybody](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=468)," through Michael Saylor's [nonprofit educational platform](https://twitter.com/saylordotorg). The 12-hour course contains five units of material under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license, with the option to earn a certificate of completion. The final unit, 'Bitcoin in Practice,' focuses on [privacy and security basics](https://learn.saylor.org/mod/page/view.php?id=30743):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Using Bitcoin privately and securely is not "on by default". There are active steps that a user must undertake to improve their privacy and security. In this article, you will learn some of the basic pointers with privacy, such as network privacy and transaction graph privacy.

## February 15th - NEW REUSABLE PAYMENT CODES BIP DRAFT

Justus Ranvier published a draft for "[Reusable Payment Codes for Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets, version 3](https://github.com/justusranvier/obpp-rfc/blob/bip47/obpp-05.mediawiki)," which extends his prior [BIP-47](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) specification from 2015. The proposal recommends using [BIP-157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki) client-side filtering with [OBPP-4 Enhanced Selectivity filters](https://github.com/justusranvier/obpp-rfc/blob/bip47/obpp-04.mediawiki) for detecting notification transactions. Currently, the only wallet which implements these [Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) stealth addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ECDH_address) is [**Samourai Wallet**](https://samouraiwallet.com/bips), which recently [celebrated its sixth-year anniversary](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1359087712129712130). I have previously covered [PayNyms](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1361399254594572290) in [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-20th---dirtcoin-diaries-paynym-torch) and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-30th---introducing-soroban).

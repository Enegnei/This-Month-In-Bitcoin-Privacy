## April 1st - IRS JOHN DOE SUMMONS TO EXCHANGES

The U.S. Department of Justice reported that the IRS has served a John Doe summons to Circle, "[seeking information about U.S. taxpayers who conducted at least the equivalent of $20,000 in transactions in cryptocurrency during the years 2016 to 2020](https://archive.ph/k6bAZ)." They have [also filed the same request](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/100381/irs-kraken-petition-court-john-doe-summons) to Kraken.

## April 4th - ONION78 WINS MIT BITCOIN EXPO 2021 TRACK

On the second day of the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology** (MIT) [Bitcoin Club](https://twitter.com/MITBitcoinClub)'s Expo 2021, member Manish Kumar announced the winners of their 30-hour virtual hackathon ([Day 2, Part 4](https://mitbitcoinexpo.org/) - 27:15). The 'Bitcoin and Lightning' track prize winner was a project called [Onion'78](https://github.com/armins88/Onion78), a mobile BIP-78 PayJoin implementation by [Dan Gould](https://twitter.com/dangoulddev), [Armin Sabouri](https://github.com/armins88), [Johns Beharry](https://twitter.com/johnsBeharry/status/1378339171098619905), and [Ron Stoner](https://twitter.com/forwardsecrecy/status/1379134840520384513).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Our project aims to implement the payjoin standard (BIP-78) and privacy features (Tor Hidden Services) into an existing mobile wallet application (Chaincase). A mobile wallet was selected due to its ease of accessibility and portability, low cost profile for required hardware, and access to application distribution pipelines -- providing a benefit to those who are attempting to remain as private as possible with as little footprint as possible, anywhere in the world.

[Chaincase](https://twitter.com/chaincaseapp) is an iOS client "[built on top of the famed Wasabi Wallet](https://github.com/chaincase-app/Chaincase)," in development by Gould since 2019 and still in beta testing with CoinJoin since [September 2020](https://twitter.com/chaincaseapp/status/1305252210343845891). In March, he had asked if users would like to "[receive PayJoin from Chaincase](https://twitter.com/chaincaseapp/status/1376902203861037062)." Onion'78, as [a fork](https://twitter.com/chaincaseapp/status/1379942091208458240) of Chaincase with PayJoin, is now open for [beta testing](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Edhp2cXj). Gibson commented, "[if this BIP78 implementation makes its way into production mobile wallets, will be a great selling point](https://x0f.org/@waxwing/106074588318311088)." You can watch a demo [here](https://youtu.be/UsHOQIykfDo).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

I have previously covered PayJoin development in [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-5th---payjoin-support-in-wasabi-and-joinmarket), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-13th---bip78-payjoin-receiver-in-joinmarket), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-24th---coldcard-beta-payjoin-support), and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-15th---tracking-payjoin-adoption).

## April 6th - SIGNAL INTEGRATES MOBILECOIN (SORT OF)

In [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-15th---signal-accepts-bitcoin-donations), I included that the **Signal Technology Foundation** had started accepting cryptocurrency donations. It seems that this was a precursor for their next major move: integrating [MobileCoin](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin). Less than a month later, they [announced](https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1379472676905963523) that U.K.-based beta testers would get access to a new feature, [Signal Payments](https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/). MobileCoin (MOB) -- based on parts of Stellar and Monero, ring confidential transactions (RingCTs) and Bulletproofs -- has been in development since 2017, when it was reported that Signal's founder and CEO Moxie Marlinspike was working on it "[as technical advisor for the last four months, alongside technologist Joshua Goldbard](https://archive.is/HrqMv#selection-563.45-563.130)." They emphasized its reliance on Intel's proprietary and [oft-broken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions#Attacks) Software Guard Extensions (SGX) as one of the primary "special features," used to both "hide the currency's indelible ledger from view" and store private keys. And don't forget [Microsoft Azure confidential computing](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/844245-mobilecoin-banking-and-capital-markets-azure). According to their [FAQ](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin#faq), without using SGX, "you will not be able to participate in consensus with other validator nodes." All Americans and U.S.-based persons, along with several other jurisdictions, are explicitly "[prohibited](https://archive.is/Vi07R)" from downloading the software or using MobileCoin in any way. Awkward, given that their promotional video centers on footage of well-off shoppers in San Francisco.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[Goldbard](https://www.mobilecoin.foundation/board-member/joshua-goldbard), now CEO of MobileCoin Inc. and [board member](https://medium.com/mobilecoin/welcoming-joshua-goldbard-to-the-mobilecoin-foundation-board-2c9c2161b63e) to the [foundation](https://medium.com/mobilecoin/the-mobilecoin-foundation-a592723bcd8e), wrote on the [**Hacker News**](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26726246) forums that he "started MobileCoin to fund Signal. That's it." He also noted that "MobileCoin has made over 50% of the coins available for purchase. We are currently figuring out how to give away coins while remaining regulatory compliant," and "MobileCoin Inc. intends to maintain an extreme minority of the coins once the dust settles." Concern over the distribution of coins stemmed from a supposed [early version of their whitepaper](https://web.archive.org/web/20200202110851/https://mixin.one/assets/MobileCoin-Whitepaper-EN_FINAL.pdf), which states that 37.5 million ERC-20 tokens were pre-sold at 0.80 cents per MOB. (Note: While the details seem to be largely consistent with their 'official' [whitepaper](https://web.archive.org/web/20171215230522/https://www.mobilecoin.com/whitepaper-en.pdf), [prior versions of their website](https://web.archive.org/web/20180407193600/https://www.mobilecoin.com/), and other [documents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739466/000173946618000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml), [Goldbard claims it is not authentic](https://www.coindesk.com/signal-founder-may-have-been-more-than-tech-adviser-mobilecoin).) In April 2018, they had opened a funding round for $30 million "[denominated in Ethereum and Bitcoin](https://medium.com/mobilecoin/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency-designed-for-everyone-a36d3355920b)," and in May they filed a notice of offering of securities through a $29.7 million "[simple agreement for future tokens](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739466/000173946618000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml)" with the SEC.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

While their marketing espouses that "MobileCoin is money that puts your privacy first,"

## April 9th - TREZOR TO ADD COINJOIN AND COIN CONTROL

Hardware wallet company [**Trezor**](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1380464406065209348) announced "four things that are about to happen this year" regarding their products.

## April 11th - FROM CHAINALYSIS CHIEF TO FINCEN DIRECTOR

On April 2nd, the [**Financial Crimes Enforcement Network**](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-acting-director-and-new-deputy-director) (FinCEN) announced that Kenneth Blanco would be departing as director on April 9th, and Michael Mosier "will return to FinCEN as Acting Director" of the bureau on April 11th. Mosier "most recently served as Counselor to the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, a role he assumed last month" after serving as [FinCEN’s deputy director](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-welcomes-michael-mosier-deputy-director-and-digital-innovation-officer).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Between June 2019 and February 2020, [**Chainalysis**](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/chainalysis-chief-technical-counsel-hire) had appointed him as Chief Technical Counsel, "responsible for bringing legal expertise to our products, including data privacy and global anti-money laundering (AML), sanctions, policy, and government matters." He was expected to "work closely with Jesse Spiro, Global Head of Policy, who recently joined Chainalysis from **Refinitiv**." In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-19th---chainalysis-and-crypto-exposed-persons), I highlighted Spiro's background and writing regarding the development of a growing financial watchlist category, the crypto-exposed person. In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-7th---chainalysis-and-the-boiling-frog) and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-5th---chainalysis-lobbying), I have covered other hires and advisors to the company with regulatory ties, and in [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-4th---irs-still-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins) their government contracts. The [revolving door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_%28politics%29) spins 'round and 'round!
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On April 4th, during her presentation for the [MIT Bitcoin Club](https://twitter.com/MITBitcoinClub)'s Expo 2021 virtual conference, **Chainalysis** senior economist and head of research [Kimberly Grauer](https://mitbitcoinexpo.org/31/f3/31f385b9.html) claimed that their business "only captures criminal activity native to the blockchain," and reported that "less than 0.5%" of cryptocurrency funds were "associated with illicity activity in 2020" ([Day 2, Part 2](https://mitbitcoinexpo.org/) - 38:35).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> We sell software to law enforcement. I wish they would tell us everything about all the cases, just because I'm interested, but they don't often tell us. It is really sensitive, what is going on. [With] a lot of these cases, people have been working on investigations for years and there is a lot of really sensitive information, so there is a reason why we're not included in that side of things. We do get to learn about cases; sometimes they release information publicly and we learn about it in a news announcement. Then we try to figure out what allowed them to come to this enforcement action. Did they do all of it using our tool, or did they have reason to suspect someone and they used our tool to get more evidence so that they could have a more complete case? All of those things are part of the story.

## April 15th - TAPROOT ACTIVATION SPECIFICATION MERGED

In [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-2nd---recurring-taproot-meetings), I summarised ongoing discussion and progress with Schnorr / Taproot activation, and that continues this month. On April 4th, **What Bitcoin Did** host Peter McCormack interviewed **Blockstream** research director [Andrew Poelstra](https://github.com/apoelstra) about "[Taproot Activation, Applications and Benefits](https://archive.is/yza0g)," and [c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) engineer [Lisa Neigut](https://twitter.com/niftynei) about Lightning, for the [MIT Bitcoin Club](https://twitter.com/MITBitcoinClub)'s virtual conference ([Day 2, Part 1](https://mitbitcoinexpo.org/) - 41:00 and 1:18:55 respectively). Neigut spoke about Schnorr / Taproot as "a big opportunity for Lightning to become more private" since "the on-chain footprint will hopefully largely disappear." Poelstra talked about how Taproot was developed and the ongoing -- but relatively minor -- activation drama.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> For the last year or so, Taproot has been going full [blast] with all sorts of exciting stuff. I am basically working on applications on top of Taproot and not really looking at what is happening on the blockchain layer. The blockchain stuff is largely Pieter Wuille, who opened the pull-request in Bitcoin Core that has since been merged and implements Taproot. It was a massive pull-request, a magnum opus that a lot of people reviewed. There are several other names, maybe a dozen people who have been actively developing.
> 
> What's really exciting about the development this time around, compared to SegWit and anything else we've done in the past, is that we have probably over one hundred active reviewers. People are really digging into this code, asking hard questions, asking to change things. We've had a lot of eyes on the code and the design.

Following the Easter break, a meeting was held on [April 6th](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018725.html) mainly to discuss whether to use [BIP-113](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki) median time-past (MTP) or block height for the start and timeout parameters. Rubin reported that several participants, finding either option acceptable, agreed to engage in a [coin flip](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018742.html):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> As such a coinflip is being run via `bitcoin-cli getblockhash $((678059+20)) | cut -b64 | grep -q '[02468ace]' && echo MTP || echo height` (that's about 13 blocks from writing). If it comes up MTP, contributors mentioned below will work towards moving MTP forwards. If it comes up height, contributors mentioned below will work towards moving height forwards.

The outcome was "[in favor of MTP](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018746.html)." [Folkson](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018755.html) and others disagreed with this method of decision-making. [Corallo](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018757.html) pointed out that "the two authors of actual code for the two proposals here also came to an agreement on a way forward, so it's not like it was a 'coin toss to overrule everyone on the other side.'" [Harding](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018758.html) referenced an [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282) (IETF) document on rough consensus, and explained that this was "the same method I've been using in Bitcoin-related discussions for over seven years[3] to help people transition from ancillary arguments back to working on the things they really think are important."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-11th---design-sketch-for-first-version-of-coinswap), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-1st---smore-schnorr), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-14th---smore-schnorr-and-tapscript), and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-4th---musig2), I have featured development of the Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme MuSig and its variations. On April 10th, [Adam Gibson](https://x0f.org/@waxwing/106057094012147826) published "[The Soundness of MuSig](https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/the-soundness-of-musig/)," a review of "how we can (or can't) be sure of the security of these type of Schnorr-based multisig constructions, as we intend to use them in Bitcoin."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> MuSig2 ditches that initial commitment (or perhaps folds it in!), so we are at two rounds. But! The good news is that the first round (the sharing of *R*<sub>*i,j*</sub>, *j*= 1...*v*) can be *pre-processed* since it *does not depend on the message to be signed*. That means in effect that multisignature signing can be (more or less) non-interactive, in the same way that Bitcoin multisig is today (that is: when you have a message to sign, you can just sign it and share with peer(s), although, here, slightly more pre-coordination, in advance at some point, is required due to the nonce setup).
>
> And all this is achieved while maintaining the properties mentioned at the start as desirable: we use a single aggregate key on-chain, making verification indistinguishable from single sig, so better privacy and better scaling (since we achieve the goal without changing the compact nature of the single Schnorr sig).

On [April 13th](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018769.html), another meeting was held to discuss Anthony Towns' "speedy trial" pull-request [#21377](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21377) and its differences with a user-activated soft fork (UASF) "[alternative release](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018783.html)." On April 15th, the "speedy trial" specification was [merged](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/2cd834e6c09dbbb676ecac4a36d8f0f56b4fe4b2) into Bitcoin Core by maintainer [Michael Ford](https://github.com/fanquake). For the parameters it uses a "[mix of MTP and block height, BIP to be decided](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018790.html)." On April 19th, lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan published [the first release candidate](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2021-April/000098.html) of [Bitcoin Core 0.21.1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes.md) to the mailing list, which includes these "speedy trial" activation parameters.

## April 20th - FATF PUBLIC CONSULTATION CLOSES

In [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-19th---fatf-public-consultation-on-virtual-assets), I examined the response to the [**Financial Action Task Force**](https://twitter.com/FATFNews/status/1372941001145323526) (FATF)'s [public consultation](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html) on its guidance for virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On April 2nd, [**Unconfirmed**](https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/1378459553323433987) podcast host Laura Shin interviewed [Dave Jevans](https://twitter.com/davejevans), CEO of the blockchain surveillance company **CipherTrace**, about the guidance for [episode #171](https://youtu.be/sXqq_iRlanU). He stated that being classified as a VASP would require "DeFi" platforms to engage in "identifying the customer (so KYC), performing sanctions screening of transactions and addresses so you don't receive funds from sanctioned addresses etc., and potentially the implementation of the so-called Travel Rule."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> I think we've been highlighting it at CipherTrace and some of the other work we do with [Global Digital Finance](https://www.gdf.io/) (GDF), [Chamber of Digital Commerce](https://digitalchamber.org/), and [Travel Rule Information Sharing Alliance](https://trisa.io/) (TRISA) for probably four, five, six months. I would say much of the industry is not really thinking about it, thinks this isn't going to happen, or there are specific loopholes in regulations that prevent them from having to do anything. I think this is the first shot across the bow.
> 
> I would also say that this is not broad public notice of proposed rulemaking like we saw from FinCEN in the United States in December and January. It is open to anyone, but it is a much more closed group. It is not widely publicized. There will be meetings next week. We're recording this [podcast] in early April. On April 8th, there will be a meeting of a number of industry participants. On April 15th, there will be a broader meeting of industry participants. I encourage everyone to get involved in those as much as possible, because the proposed recommendations will probably be announced around June 15th 2021 -- in which case it would probably be too late to get your voice heard.

Of course his [company](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413065736/https://ciphertrace.com/) just so happens (:innocent:) to provide [tools](https://ciphertrace.com/defi-compli-sanctions-compliance-oracle/) and services for these purposes!
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On April 6th, [**Bitcoin Association Switzerland**](https://www.bitcoinassociation.ch/) president Lucas Betschart commented:

> The FATF Travel Rule will lead exchanges to disable exchange-to-exchange transactions and only allow transactions to non-custodial wallets. Result: More people using non-custodial wallets... Switzerland is one of the few countries where the Travel Rule is already in place by the regulator. It resulted in all the VASP (crypto exchanges, brokers, banks) only allowing transactions with non-custodial wallets. I think this is also globally a way more likely outcome than the industry agreeing on a standard for implementing the Travel Rule AND the big exchanges actually implementing the Travel Rule at all (often based in jurisdictions who are rather relaxed regarding compliance).

On April 11th, Dutch engineer and financial history consultant [Simon Lelieveldt](https://www.simonl.org/) published [an article](https://twitter.com/finhstamsterdam/status/1381101196136570881) about how their central bank (DNB) was "[in the act of frontrunning the FATF-rules](https://finhstamsterdam.medium.com/dutch-judge-slaps-dnb-dutch-central-bank-on-the-wrist-in-court-case-of-crypto-pioneer-bitonic-on-b9ca5d9c145)." He also tweeted [a fascinating thread](https://twitter.com/finhstamsterdam/status/1381291540480417795) about the FATF itself being a "red flag" as an organisation, given that he was not able to obtain information about their articles of association or legal entity identifier. "[We must see it as a hostile takeover of tax authorities seeking illegitimate ways to harvest commercial data beyond the remit of pe.nal law rules](https://twitter.com/finhstamsterdam/status/1381297819483521032)." He had previously [cited](https://twitter.com/finhstamsterdam/status/1287716270595506176) a research paper from the [**Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society**](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/law/departments/ltms), "[analysing the necessity and proportionality](http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=150061)" of regulations like AMLD, and concluding their foundation was "shaky, untrue and outright bizarre." In January, he had also published [his comments to FinCEN](http://moneyandpayments.simonl.org/2021/01/response-by-simon-lelieveldt-to-fincen.html) regarding their proposed rulemaking (covered in [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all) and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-20th---fincen-proposed-rulemaking-suspended)). "I find it quite ironic that the US, that [saved the Dutch population from a dictatorial regime](https://financieelerfgoed.wordpress.com/2020/05/02/contemplating-75-years-of-freedom-a-dark-story-on-three-dutch-lessons-never-learnt/), that taught us about the importance of human rights, true democracies, freedom of speech, privacy and the importance of the presumption of innocence, is now the country that violates the values it has inspired into others."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On April 19th, one day before the end of the consultation, FATF tweeted a reminder to "[share your views](https://twitter.com/FATFNews/status/1384080213567426562)" on the draft guidance. [**Coin Center**](https://www.coincenter.org/people/peter-van-valkenburgh/)'s [Peter van Valkenburgh](https://twitter.com/valkenburgh/status/1384523356796596225) submitted their [extensive commentary](https://www.coincenter.org/app/uploads/2021/04/CoinCenterFATFGuidance.pdf) and summarised it in [a blog post](https://www.coincenter.org/expansive-standards-for-surveillance-threaten-human-autonomy-our-message-to-fatf/). Regarding various "internal contradictions" in this proposed conception of a VASP, Valkenburgh writes that they will be "making persons’ privacy and speech rights vulnerable to arbitrary curtailment from overzealous prosecution."

> As we argue in our full comment, this classification would violate essential human rights to privacy and free expression described in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and the U.S. Constitution. Under the ICCPR surveillance obligations must always be “reasonable in the particular circumstances” and the law must “specify in detail the precise circumstances” in which surveillance is permitted. Under the ECHR, privacy invasive laws must be “formulated with sufficient precision to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to measures of surveillance.” The proposed guidance’s vague and contradictory standards do not conform with those basic guarantees of the rule of law and human dignity described within the ICCPR and ECHR.

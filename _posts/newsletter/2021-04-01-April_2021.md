## April 9th - FROM CHAINALYSIS CHIEF TO FINCEN DIRECTOR

On April 2nd, the [**Financial Crimes Enforcement Network**](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-acting-director-and-new-deputy-director) (FinCEN) announced that Kenneth Blanco would be departing as director on April 9th, and Michael Mosier "will return to FinCEN as Acting Director" of the bureau on April 11th. Mosier "most recently served as Counselor to the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, a role he assumed last month" after serving as [FinCENâ€™s deputy director](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-welcomes-michael-mosier-deputy-director-and-digital-innovation-officer).

Between June 2019 and February 2020, [**Chainalysis**](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/chainalysis-chief-technical-counsel-hire) had appointed him as Chief Technical Counsel, "responsible for bringing legal expertise to our products, including data privacy and global anti-money laundering (AML), sanctions, policy, and government matters." He was expected to "work closely with Jesse Spiro, Global Head of Policy, who recently joined Chainalysis from Refinitiv." In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-19th---chainalysis-and-crypto-exposed-persons), I highlighted Spiro's background and writing regarding the development of a growing financial watchlist category, the crypto-exposed person. In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-7th---chainalysis-and-the-boiling-frog) and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-5th---chainalysis-lobbying), I have covered other hires and advisors to the company with regulatory ties, and in [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-4th---irs-still-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins) their government contracts. The [revolving door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_%28politics%29) spins 'round and 'round!

## April 15th - TAPROOT ACTIVATION SPECIFICATION MERGED

In [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-2nd---recurring-taproot-meetings), I summarised ongoing discussion and progress with Schnorr / Taproot activation. Following the Easter break, a meeting was held on [April 6th](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018725.html) mainly to discuss whether to use [BIP-113](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki) median time-past (MTP) or block height for the start and timeout parameters. Rubin reported that several participants, finding either option acceptable, agreed to engage in a [coin flip](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018742.html):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> As such a coinflip is being run via `bitcoin-cli getblockhash $((678059+20)) | cut -b64 | grep -q '[02468ace]' && echo MTP || echo height` (that's about 13 blocks from writing). If it comes up MTP, contributors mentioned below will work towards moving MTP forwards. If it comes up height, contributors mentioned below will work towards moving height forwards.

The outcome was "[in favor of MTP](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018746.html)." [Folkson](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018755.html) and others disagreed with this method of decision-making. [Corallo](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018757.html) pointed out that "the two authors of actual code for the two proposals here also came to an agreement on a way forward, so it's not like it was a 'coin toss to overrule everyone on the other side.'" [Harding](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018758.html) referenced an [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282) (IETF) document on rough consensus, and explained that this was "the same method I've been using in Bitcoin-related discussions for over seven years[3] to help people transition from ancillary arguments back to working on the things they really think are important."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On [April 13th](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018769.html), another meeting was held to discuss Anthony Towns' "speedy trial" pull-request [#21377](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21377) and its differences with a user-activated soft fork (UASF) "[alternative release](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018783.html)." On April 15th, the "speedy trial" specification was [merged](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/2cd834e6c09dbbb676ecac4a36d8f0f56b4fe4b2) into Bitcoin Core by maintainer [Michael Ford](https://github.com/fanquake). For the parameters it uses a "[mix of MTP and block height, BIP to be decided](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018790.html)."

## April 20th - FATF PUBLIC CONSULTATION CLOSES

In [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-19th---fatf-public-consultation-on-virtual-assets), I examined the response to the [Financial Action Task Force](https://twitter.com/FATFNews/status/1372941001145323526) (FATF)'s [public consultation](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html) on its guidance for virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs).

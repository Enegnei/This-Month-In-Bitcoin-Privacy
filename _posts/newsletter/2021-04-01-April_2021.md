## April 9th - FROM CHAINALYSIS CHIEF TO FINCEN DIRECTOR

On April 2nd, the [**Financial Crimes Enforcement Network**](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-acting-director-and-new-deputy-director) (FinCEN) announced that Kenneth Blanco would be departing as director on April 9th, and Michael Mosier "will return to FinCEN as Acting Director" of the bureau on April 11th. Mosier "most recently served as Counselor to the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, a role he assumed last month" after serving as [FinCENâ€™s deputy director](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-welcomes-michael-mosier-deputy-director-and-digital-innovation-officer).

Between June 2019 and February 2020, [**Chainalysis**](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/chainalysis-chief-technical-counsel-hire) had appointed him as Chief Technical Counsel, "responsible for bringing legal expertise to our products, including data privacy and global anti-money laundering (AML), sanctions, policy, and government matters." He was expected to "work closely with Jesse Spiro, Global Head of Policy, who recently joined Chainalysis from Refinitiv." In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-19th---chainalysis-and-crypto-exposed-persons), I highlighted Spiro's background and writing regarding the development of a growing financial watchlist category, the crypto-exposed person. In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-7th---chainalysis-and-the-boiling-frog) and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-5th---chainalysis-lobbying), I have covered other hires and advisors to the company with regulatory ties, and in [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-4th---irs-still-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins) their government contracts. The [revolving door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_%28politics%29) spins 'round and 'round!

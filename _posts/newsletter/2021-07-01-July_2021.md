## July 6th - BISQ PATCHES PRIVACY VULNERABILITY

In [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-3rd---removing-tor-v2-support), I included that [**Bisq**](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1409868701327781888) would set the [v1.7.0](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.7.0) release as the "required minimum version for trading" and fixed "a privacy issue." On July 6th, they [disclosed](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1412536933910147072) the nature of this vulnerability:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Exchanging peers' payment account data is required for certain verifications and (of course) for peers to actually carry out payment. Before 1.7.0, this data had been exchanged earlier in the trade process so that verifications could be done earlier, and so the trade process could fail earlier (in case a peer provided invalid account data). This approach made it possible for malicious peers to see the account data of a peer without engaging in an actual trade... with manipulated Bisq software, it was (theoretically) possible to do this without incurring costs (fees, locked in BTC, etc).
> 
> To mitigate this vulnerability, exchanging account data now occurs later, only after both traders have committed to the deposit tx. This creates a financial burden for a malicious peer trying to harvest trading peers' account data.
> 
> We are not aware of any instances in which this vulnerability was abused. Such abuse would have led to failed trades, and at scale, Bisq support would have noticed trends in users reporting such a problem. We've asked the folks who tipped us off about this for permission to give them credit, but have not received a response yet. Will add credit here if/when we get the appropriate guidance.
> 
> Also in 1.7.0 was another protocol update: the hash of the trade contract is no longer an OP_RETURN output of the deposit tx. This was initially introduced to have cryptographic commitment of both traders in the contract, since signing deposit tx signified signing the contract. This output resulted in larger transactions (more mining fees), polluting the Bitcoin blockchain with data, and making Bisq transactions more distinctive and easier to spot on the blockchain. So it's now gone.

A core developer of [Haveno](https://twitter.com/HavenoDEX/status/1412782658887766016), a [Monero-focused decentralised exchange](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno) that launched in [May](https://twitter.com/HavenoDEX/status/1388269321101750276), claimed credit for discovering the problem "while working on Haveno's protocol (part of which we inherit from Bisq). We immediately contacted Bisq and gave them all the info and support to fix the vulnerability."

## July 7th - WASABI WALLET 2.0 UPDATE

## July 10th - TAPROOT ADOPTION

## July 12th - THE DANGER OF KYC

## July 20th - EU ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROPOSALS

## July 26th - A SURVEY ON MIXING TECHNIQUES

Vienna-based researchers [Simin Ghesmati](https://www.sba-research.org/team/simin-ghesmati/), [Walid Fdhila](https://www.sba-research.org/team/walid-fdhila/), and [Edgar Weippl](https://www.sba-research.org/team/edgar-weippl/) have shared a revised preprint of their new paper, "[Bitcoin Privacy - A Survey on Mixing Techniques](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/629.pdf)." Covering centralized mixers, CoinJoin based mixing, atomic swaps, and threshold signatures, their aim is to compare and evaluate "mixing techniques in the Bitcoin blockchain, present their limitations, and highlight the new challenges.{: style="text-align: justify;"}

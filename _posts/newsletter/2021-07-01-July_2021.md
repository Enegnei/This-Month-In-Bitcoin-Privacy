## July 1st - SAMOURAI WALLET AND ATMOIC SWAPS

## July 4th - THE FREEDOM OF BITCOIN

## July 6th - BISQ PATCHES PRIVACY VULNERABILITY

In [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-3rd---removing-tor-v2-support), I included that [**Bisq**](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1409868701327781888) would set the [v1.7.0](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.7.0) hardfork release as the "required minimum version for trading" and fixed "a privacy issue." On July 6th, they [disclosed](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1412536933910147072) the nature of this vulnerability:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Exchanging peers' payment account data is required for certain verifications and (of course) for peers to actually carry out payment. Before 1.7.0, this data had been exchanged earlier in the trade process so that verifications could be done earlier, and so the trade process could fail earlier (in case a peer provided invalid account data). This approach made it possible for malicious peers to see the account data of a peer without engaging in an actual trade... with manipulated Bisq software, it was (theoretically) possible to do this without incurring costs (fees, locked in BTC, etc).
> 
> To mitigate this vulnerability, exchanging account data now occurs later, only after both traders have committed to the deposit tx. This creates a financial burden for a malicious peer trying to harvest trading peers' account data.
> 
> We are not aware of any instances in which this vulnerability was abused. Such abuse would have led to failed trades, and at scale, Bisq support would have noticed trends in users reporting such a problem. We've asked the folks who tipped us off about this for permission to give them credit, but have not received a response yet. Will add credit here if/when we get the appropriate guidance.
> 
> Also in 1.7.0 was another protocol update: the hash of the trade contract is no longer an OP_RETURN output of the deposit tx. This was initially introduced to have cryptographic commitment of both traders in the contract, since signing deposit tx signified signing the contract. This output resulted in larger transactions (more mining fees), polluting the Bitcoin blockchain with data, and making Bisq transactions more distinctive and easier to spot on the blockchain. So it's now gone.

A core developer of [Haveno](https://twitter.com/HavenoDEX/status/1412782658887766016), a [Monero-focused decentralised exchange](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno) that launched in [May](https://twitter.com/HavenoDEX/status/1388269321101750276), claimed credit for discovering the problem "while working on Haveno's protocol (part of which we inherit from Bisq). We immediately contacted Bisq and gave them all the info and support to fix the vulnerability."

## July 7th - WASABI WALLET 2.0 UPDATE

## July 10th - TAPROOT ADOPTION

## July 12th - THE DANGER OF KYC

## July 20th - FATF REPORT AND EU AML PROPOSALS

The [European Commission](https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1417494474662498306) announced a package of new legislative proposals that will, according to them, "[strengthen the EU’s anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) rules](https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/210720-anti-money-laundering-countering-financing-terrorism_en)." They note that it "will be discussed by the European Parliament and Council," with the aim to become "operational in 2024."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The package also includes a proposal for the creation of a new EU authority to fight money laundering. It is part of the Commission’s commitment to protect EU citizens and the EU's financial system from money laundering and terrorist financing. The aim is to improve the detection of suspicious transactions and activities, and close loopholes used by criminals to launder illicit proceeds or finance terrorist activities through the financial system.

Due to the absence of clear definitions for 'crypto-asset wallets' and 'crypto-asset service providers' internally, as well as commissioner [Mairead McGuinness](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/mcguinness_en)' [declaration](https://twitter.com/McGuinnessEU/status/1417494016741023753), many were given the impression that this legislation will [try to ban private wallets in general](https://reason.com/2021/07/27/eu-bureaucrats-seek-to-diminish-your-cryptocurrency-privacy/):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The anonymity of crypto-assets exposes them to risks of misuse for criminal purposes. Anonymous crypto-asset wallets do not allow the traceability of crypto-asset transfers, whilst also making it difficult to identify linked transactions that may raise suspicion or to apply to adequate level of customer due diligence. In order to ensure effective application of AML/CFT requirements to crypto-assets, it is necessary to prohibit the provision and the custody of anonymous crypto-asset wallets by crypto-asset service providers.

However, further reading shows that their focus seems limited to custodial wallets and accounts. In Chapter VII, they set a prohibition "[dis]allowing for the anonymisation of the customer account holder" by financial institutions, as well as a Union-wide ceiling for cash payments "only up to an amount of EUR 10000 or equivalent amount in national or foreign currency," though this will not apply to "private operations between individuals" / "payments between natural persons _who are not acting in a professional function_" (italics added). Regarding 'crypto-asset service provider,' the term was previously defined by "[Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on Markets in Crypto-assets, and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593)," in Article 3: "any person whose occupation or business is the provision of one or more crypto-asset services to third parties on a professional basis."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> (9) ‘crypto-asset service’ means any of the services and activities listed below relating to any crypto-asset:
>> (a) the custody and administration of crypto-assets on behalf of third parties;
>> (b) the operation of a trading platform for crypto-assets;
>> (c) the exchange of crypto-assets for fiat currency that is legal tender;
>> (d) the exchange of crypto-assets for other crypto-assets;
>> (e) the execution of orders for crypto-assets on behalf of third parties;
>> (f) placing of crypto-assets;
>> (g) the reception and transmission of orders for crypto-assets on behalf of third parties;
>> (h) providing advice on crypto-assets; 

While 'providing advice' seems rather broad, they narrow it down to broker-like activities:

> offering, giving or agreeing to give personalised or specific recommendations to a third party, either at the third party’s request or on the initiative of the crypto-asset service provider providing the advice, concerning the acquisition or the sale of one or more crypto-assets, or the use of crypto-asset services

A spokesperson for the Commission indeed later clarified that [non-custodial wallets are not included in these categories](https://cryptonews.com/news/european-commission-clarifies-what-it-means-by-anonymous-cry-11147.htm), aligning with a previously reported opinion from Europol regarding whether **Wasabi Wallet** fell under the [AMLD5](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/anti-money-laundering-amld-v-directive-eu-2018-843_en) regulations ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-4th---europol-cybercrime-report-on-wasabi-wallet)). They also implied that 'crypto-asset service provider' was functionally equivalent to the **Financial Action Task Force** (FATF)'s 'virtual asset service provider' (VASP); the proposal mentions the FATF frequently, even claiming to be "in line with" and "going beyond FATF standards."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Last month, [European Data Protection Board](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/who-we-are_en) (EDPB) chair Andrea Jelinek wrote [a letter](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-05/letter_to_ec_on_proposals_on_aml-cft_en.pdf) to commissioners McGuinness and [Didier Reynders](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/reynders_en) about "the data protection implications of AML laws," particuarly given McGuinness' [statement](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_3807) that this new authority (AMLA) will pursue "setting up a system to connect national registers for bank accounts" to "provide faster access for Financial Intelligence Units and other authorities to get access to key information." Jelinek wrote that the common 'risk-based approach' standard "is not clearly enough quantified or defined in legislation or through guidance from regulatory bodies," leading to "a large quantity of false positive alarms," "unnecessary and disproportionate processing" by obliged entites. Therefore, the EDPB recommended including "specific provisions in the upcoming legislative proposals in order to specify the application of the GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] in the context of the AML-CFT legal framework, pursuant to Article 6 (3) of the GDPR."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Indeed, a fair balance has to be struck between the interest to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, on the one hand, and the interests underlying the fundamental rights to data protection and privacy, on the other... enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
> 
> If the AML-CFT legislation is not designed in a balanced and proportionate manner, that respects every individuals’ fundamental rights to data protection, legal uncertainties for obliged entities will continue to exist and the AML-CFT framework would be vulnerable. Data Protection Authorities will be forced to use their powers in order to bring the activities of the obliged entities in accordance with the GDPR through corrective measures. European citizens will also likely exercise their right to an effective remedy before a tribunal, enshrined in the Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

According to Dutch engineer and financial history consultant [Simon Lelieveldt](https://www.simonl.org/), the ambiguity of the language is still concerning. While they may not explicitly ban the use of non-custodial wallets, "[the FATF is pushing countries to not license/register companies if they allow communications with unhosted/anonymous wallets](https://twitter.com/finhstamsterdam/status/1417935973187473409)." As I highlighted in March, this isolation / exclusion strategy was already in their [new draft](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319175919/http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/March%202021%20-%20VA%20Guidance%20update%20-%20Sixth%20draft%20-%20Public%20consultation.pdf).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-19th---fatf-public-consultation-on-virtual-assets), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-20th---fatf-public-consultation-closes), and [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-25th---fatf-delays-finalising-guidance), I covered the FATF’s public consultation regarding their guidance on "[the risk-based approach to virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs)](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html)." In their [second 12-month review](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Second-12-Month-Review-Revised-FATF-Standards-Virtual-Assets-VASPS.pdf) published early this month, they report that some VASPs were using jurisdictional arbitrage to continue operating with "extremely weak or non-existent AML/CFT controls," and that "the last year has seen significant increase in the use of privacy wallet transfers where multiple people’s transactions are combined into a single transfer, such as CoinJoin." Overall, though, they acknowledge that "the value of virtual assets involved in most ML/TF cases detected to date remains relatively small compared to cases using more traditional financial services and products," and that restrictions inspired by their guidance negatively impact privacy and financial inclusion:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In implementing AML/CFT regimes for VASPs, the FATF and jurisdictions should be aware of the intersection and potential impact AML/CFT requirements have on other regulatory requirements and policy areas, such as data protection and privacy, financial inclusion, derisking, consumer and investor protection and financial innovation. The FATF is committed to financial inclusion and is aware that applying an overly rigid, rules-based approach to AML/CFT safeguards when providing financial services can have the unintended consequence of excluding legitimate consumers and businesses from the regulated financial system.

On July 16th, [**General Bytes**](https://www.generalbytes.com/en/news/new-ceo) CTO and product manager [Karel Kyovsky](https://twitter.com/b00l) [wrote](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-July/019268.html) to the mailing list to "propose a standardization of the bitcoin URI parameter name that could be optionally used to contain the unique id of VASP (Virtual asset service provider as defined by FATF)," because they will be "working on travel rule integration for our Bitcoin ATM product." Harding replied to suggest that he draft a new BIP rather than trying to modify [BIP-21](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki), but would not comment on "your compliance situation," and other responses were [mostly negative](https://twitter.com/ODELL/status/1416870405323767810). (If you'd like an alternative, "[Join the Wasabikas](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/2415622)" podcast host Max Hillebrand recently interviewed '[Chill](https://twitter.com/thechill117)' for [episode #23](https://youtu.be/Fh2iWSJ3hDw) about the [Bleskomat](https://www.bleskomat.com/), "the world's first Lightning-only ATM" -- previously mentioned in [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-29th---like-a-clboss-lightning-privacy).)

## July 26th - A SURVEY ON MIXING TECHNIQUES
Vienna-based researchers [Simin Ghesmati](https://www.sba-research.org/team/simin-ghesmati/), [Walid Fdhila](https://www.sba-research.org/team/walid-fdhila/), and [Edgar Weippl](https://www.sba-research.org/team/edgar-weippl/) have shared a revised preprint of their new paper, "[Bitcoin Privacy - A Survey on Mixing Techniques](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/629.pdf)." Covering centralized mixers, CoinJoin based mixing, atomic swaps, and threshold signatures, their aim is to compare and evaluate "mixing techniques in the Bitcoin blockchain, present their limitations, and highlight the new challenges.{: style="text-align: justify;"}

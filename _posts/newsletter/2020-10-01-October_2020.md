## October 2nd - TAX AUTHORITIES DEMAND DISCLOSURES

Various tax authorities around the world have moved to collect personally identifying information, ownership and transaction history from cryptocurrency users.

## October 5th - EUROPOL CYBERCRIME ON WASABI AND SAMOURAI

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-4th---europol-cybercrime-report-on-wasabi-wallet), I included [a Europol report](https://web.archive.org/web/20200606093325/https://www.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_5096130532387848318.pdf) that focused on Wasabi wallet. Since then, their European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) has published another report, the [Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment](https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-iocta-2020) (IOCTA), described by executive director [Catherine De Bolle](https://www.europol.europa.eu/executive-director-of-europol) as their "flagship strategic product highlighting the dynamic and evolving threats from cybercrime."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> There has been an increase in the use of privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies and an emergence of privacy-enhanced coinjoin concepts, such as Wasabi and Samurai.

Despite being their "flagship product," it appears they 'spared no expense' (the John Hammond way) in [the graphic design department](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/1313192469291577344). The topic of cryptocurrencies is mostly covered in the section "Privacy Enhancing Wallets Emerge As A Top Threat, As Privacy Enhancing Coins Gain Popularity." If you can get passed every mention of Samourai wallet being misspelled "Samurai," then you may notice that it highlights their [remote wipe SMS commands feature](https://support.samourai.io/article/27-introduction-to-remote-commands), which is still unfortunately disabled in the [Google Play Store version](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/181821635197/temporarily-disabling-stealth-mode-remote-sms). They assert that "while Bitcoin still remains the most popular payment method... the use of privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies has somewhat increased albeit not at the rate expected by their proponents."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Monero is gradually becoming the most established privacy coin for Darkweb transactions, followed by Zcash and Dash. All these privacy coins may present a considerable obstacle to law enforcement investigations, despite the competing altcoin communities uncritically favouring their implementation over the others.

Based on a paper by [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html) senior threat researcher [Mayra Rosario Fuentes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayra-rosario-fuentes/), they also claim to have observed these "Darkweb markets" upgrading their security practices, including moving to multi-signature wallets. Fuentes' previous employment involved work as a "cyber intelligence analyst" for Symantec, [ANSER / Analytic Services Inc.](https://www.anser.org/about/), the Department of Defense, and Booz Allen Hamilton.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Administrators are also looking to upgrade their security apparatus with other new features. Some marketplaces are already shifting to wallet-less and user-less markets, adopting multi signatures on Bitcoin and Monero, lacking registration requirements and enacting no JavaScript policies. Monopoly is also a wallet-less market in which payment occurs directly between buyer and vendor, and instead of enacting transaction fees, the market receives a monthly commission. Marketplaces were observed using multi-signature wallets in their transactions<sup>[56](https://web.archive.org/web/20200608213124/https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-shifts-in-the-underground.pdf)</sup>.

## October 8th - CRYPTOCURRENCY ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK

U.S. Attorney General William "Bill" Barr and his Cyber-Digital Task Force, established in 2018, published a report on the Department of Justice's emerging "[Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework](https://web.archive.org/web/20201008191203/https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1326061/download)." The [press release](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-announces-publication-cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework) for the report states:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The Framework provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency; details the important relationships that the Department of Justice has built with regulatory and enforcement partners both within the United States government and around the world; and outlines the Department’s response strategies. 

Similar to the [FATF report](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Virtual-Assets-Red-Flag-Indicators.pdf) highlighted last month in [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-14th---fatf-report-on-red-flag-indicators),  Associate Deputy Attorney General and Task Force chair [Sujit Raman](https://www.lawfareblog.com/contributors/sraman) argues that "decentralized platforms, peer-to-peer exchangers, and anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that use non-public or private blockchains all can further obscure financial transactions from legitimate scrutiny." Later on, under 'Ongoing Challenges and Future Strategies,' they warn that their acceptance of "may undermine the AML/CFT controls used to detect suspicious activity by MSBs and other financial institutions, and may limit or even negate a business’s ability to conduct AML/CFT checks on customer activity and to satisfy BSA requirements."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Some  AECs, however, offer features, such as public view keys, that potentially can facilitate the fulfillment of AML/CFT obligations, depending upon the implementation of such features.

Under the 'Threat Overview,' they note that "these are often referred to as 'anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies' ('AECs') or 'privacy coins.' Examples of AECs include Monero, Zcash, and Dash." Under 'Legitimate Uses,' they include generalised commentary from "cryptocurrency advocates" on the value of privacy:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Cryptocurrency advocates also stress that the privacy associated with cryptocurrency, though raising significant challenges for law enforcement, can have valid and beneficial uses. For example, such advocates claim that greater anonymity may reduce the risk of account or identity theft associated with the use of traditional credit systems.  

Under 'Department of Justice Response Strategies,' they claim that "some virtual currency exchanges have attempted to withhold data requested by law enforcement agencies," including through "criminal grand jury subpoenas," by invoking the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (GDPR). They believe that "such objections to lawful requests for information" are illegitimate.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> However, GDPR does not in fact bar companies subject to U.S. jurisdiction from complying with lawful requests in criminal investigations. To the contrary, GDPR explicitly permits the disclosure of data in a number of scenarios. For example, a virtual exchange that is subject to GDPR may process the requested data under GDPR Article 6(1) when "necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject" or "necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party....”<sup>[173](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679)</sup> Similarly, under Article 49.1, international transfer of data is permitted in various circumstances, including where "the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest" or "necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller.”<sup>174</sup>

Under the section on various cooperating agencies, they cite and summarise [FinCEN's guidance](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20CVC%20Guidance%20FINAL.pdf) that was highlighted in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-4th---europol-cybercrime-report-on-wasabi-wallet) regarding whether [anonymizing software providers](https://twitter.com/matt_odell/status/1314593241858269186) are required to register and comply with money transmitter laws.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In particular, the guidance outlined the application of FinCEN’s regulations to persons who provide anonymizing services or who are engaged in activities involving anonymity-enhanced CVCs. According to FinCEN, anonymizing service providers and some AEC issuers are money transmitters, whereas an individual or entity that merely provides anonymizing software is not.

Of course, the effectiveness of FinCEN's regulations and anti-money laundering policies generally have come under closer scrutiny with the '[FinCENFiles](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/)' publications, based on [Suspicious Activity Reports](https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bank-operations/financial-crime/suspicious-activity-reports/index-suspicious-activity-reports.html) (SARs) obtained by the [**International Consortium of Investigative Journalists**](https://twitter.com/ICIJorg/status/1307726268943790083) (ICIJ). Neither the [raw nor even redacted source documents](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/download-fincen-files-transaction-data/) were published, but according to their analysis, "U.S. agencies responsible for enforcing money laundering laws rarely prosecute megabanks that break the law, and the actions authorities do take barely ripple the flood of plundered money that washes through the international financial system." This complements a study published earlier this year in [Policy Design and Practice](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25741292.2020.1725366) (PDP):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> It finds that the anti-money laundering policy intervention has less than 0.1 percent impact on criminal finances, compliance costs exceed recovered criminal funds more than a hundred times over, and banks, taxpayers and ordinary citizens are penalized more than criminal enterprises.

Relatedly, on October 2nd, the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/html/digitaleuro-report.en.html) published a report on [central bank digital currency](https://web.archive.org/web/20201002103817/https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/Report_on_a_digital_euro~4d7268b458.en.pdf) (CBDC), asserting that any CBDC "must satisfy a number of principles and requirements that are identified in this report – including robustness, safety, efficiency and protection of privacy – while complying with relevant legislation, including legislation on money laundering and the financing of terrorism." They acknowledged a desire for a European CBDC to retain the features of cash.

> Cash has distinct intrinsic features – its physical nature, the capacity to ensure privacy in payment transactions and the possibility to be used without any technical infrastructure – that are not (fully) matched by electronic payment solutions but are required by many citizens (such as population groups who are less “tech-savvy”, face barriers to access or want to ensure their privacy). Ideally, a digital euro should allow citizens to continue to make their payments much as they do today with cash.<sup>14</sup>

However, they still argued that anonymity would not be allowed with electronic payments, unlike cash:

> If the legal identity of digital euro users were not verified when they access services, any ensuing transaction would be essentially anonymous.<sup>47</sup>  While that is currently the case for banknotes and coins, regulations do not allow anonymity in electronic payments and the digital euro must in principle comply with such regulations (Requirement 10). Anonymity may have to be ruled out, not only because of legal obligations related to money laundering and terrorist financing, but also in order to limit the scope of users of the digital euro when necessary – for example to exclude some non-euro area users and prevent excessive capital flows (Requirement 13) or to avoid excessive use of the digital euro as a form of investment (Requirement 8).

On October 11th, Barr also appeared as a signatory on the "[International Statement: End-To-End Encryption and Public Safety](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety)," which seeks cooperation between technology companies and governments to "gain access to data in a readable and usable format" across "the range of encrypted services available, including device encryption, custom encrypted applications and encryption across integrated platforms."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## October 11th - BIP155 AND TOR ONIONS V3

Last year, lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan introduced [BIP-155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki), a proposal for "a new P2P message format "to gossip longer node addresses over the P2P network," known as `addrv2`. The document included reserved network IDs for various protocols, including [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/). In July of this year, the [**Tor Project**](https://twitter.com/torproject/status/1286731153957777409) announced their [deprecation timeline](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline) for Tor v2 hidden service addresses, with warnings to onion service operators and clients starting in September and then [final obsoletion in July 2021](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2020-June/014365.html).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> To very quickly summarize why we are deprecating, in one word: Safety. Onion service v2 uses RSA1024 and 80 bit SHA1 (truncated) addresses [[1](https://shattered.io/)]. It also still uses the TAP [[2](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/tor-spec.txt#n1084)] handshake which has been entirely removed from Tor for many years now _except_ v2 services. Its simplistic directory system exposes it to a variety of enumeration and location-prediction attacks that give HSDir relays too much power to enumerate or even block v2 services. Finally, v2 services are not being developed nor maintained anymore. Only the most severe security issues are being addressed.

As [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #110](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/08/12/#bitcoin-core-pr-review-club) summarised in August, while [Appendix B](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki#appendix-b-tor-v3-address-encoding) of the proposal provided instructions for upgraded Tor v3 address encoding, using them in the Bitcoin network would require implementation of `addrv2`. In May, contributor [Vasil Dimov](https://github.com/vasild) opened [an issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19031) to add this support, which got superseded by [a pull-request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19954) in September. On October 11th, "[Complete the BIP155 implementation and upgrade to TORv3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/0b2abaa666d6f3331e3246ffd64dd47946e9dcdf)" was merged; Wuille [noted](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1315105797517393920) that Bitcoin Core v0.21, currently [scheduled for release](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18947) in December, "will support Tor V3 addresses, and BIP155."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

As highlighted in [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-8th---hyperonionization), the **Tor Project** held a one-month campaign in July to "[raise awareness about onion sites](https://blog.torproject.org/more-onions-porfavor)." They have since published [a follow-up](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-brower-onion-services-challenges-opportunities) about "the challenges we faced and continue to face," including reference to a [security advisory](https://github.com/alecmuffett/eotk/blob/master/docs.d/security-advisories.d/001-torbrowser.md) criticising their priorities.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> As part of these campaigns we will emphasize the importance of deploying onion services that are secure end-to-end so Tor Browser doesn't make a wrong assumption about which data should be sent over HTTP onion connections. We're also currently improving our documentation for onion service operators and making clear Tor Browser's expectations of web sites.

## October 13th - BIP78 PAYJOIN RECEIVER IN JOINMARKET

In [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-5th---payjoin-support-in-wasabi-and-joinmarket), I highlighted progress in adding BIP-78 PayJoin support. This month, as per the [v0.7.1 release](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/releases/tag/v0.7.1), JoinMarket has also enabled receiver support. If you have a RaspiBlitz, there is [a script](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/1488#issuecomment-708334500) to manually update and [try it out](https://twitter.com/openoms/status/1316339209133862913).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> This implementation includes support for receiving BIP78 (payjoin) payments (0.7.0 introduced sending them), in Qt GUI or on command line, using either current P2SH segwit wallets ('3' addresses) or native bech32 wallets ('bc1' addresses). To support this, Joinmarket spawns a Tor onion service ("hidden service") temporarily for payment receipt, for maximum privacy.

## October 14th - IMPLEMENTING TAPROOT SCRIPT VALIDATION

On October 14th, following last month’s meeting highlighted in [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-1st---smore-schnorr), the [Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](https://twitter.com/BitcoinCorePRs/status/1314616667134140419) held their sixth meeting on BIP 340-342 developments. Hosted by [John Newberry](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery), they discussed a commit on [implementing Taproot script validation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19953/commits/72422ce396b8eba7b1a72c171c2f07dae691d1b5). You can read the meeting log [here](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19953).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The next day, this commit was among those [merged](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMerges/status/1316657575082045442) by [van der Laan](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19953#event-3880225526).

Following up on the [MuSig-DN](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1057) research from last month, [Wuille](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1316442912335384577) also shared a recently published paper, "[MuSig2: Simple Two-Round Schnorr Multi-Signatures](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1261.pdf)," co-authored by [Jonas Nick](https://twitter.com/n1ckler), [Tim Ruffing](https://twitter.com/real_or_random), and [Yannick Seurin](https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/author.php?authorkey=1078). Wuille noted that MuSig2 "doesn't support stateless signing like MuSig-DN, but also doesn't have its costs."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Most importantly, multi-signatures enjoy the efficiency of Schnorr signatures, which are very compact and cheap to store on the blockchain. Moreover, if multi-signatures can be verified as ordinary Schnorr signatures, the additional complexity introduced by multi-signatures remains on the side of the signers and is not exposed to verifiers who need not be concerned with multi-signatures at all and can simply run Schnorr signature verification. Verifiers, who are just given the signature and the aggregate public key, in fact do not even learn whether the signature was created by a single signer or by a group of signers (or equivalently, whether the public key is an aggregation of multiple keys), which is advantageous for the privacy of users.

## October 8th - JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S CRYPTOCURRENCY ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK

U.S. Attorney General William "Bill" Barr and his Cyber-Digital Task Force, established in 2018, published a report on the Department of Justice's emerging "[Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework](https://web.archive.org/web/20201008191203/https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1326061/download)." The [press release](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-announces-publication-cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework) for the report states:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The Framework provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency; details the important relationships that the Department of Justice has built with regulatory and enforcement partners both within the United States government and around the world; and outlines the Department’s response strategies. 

Similar to the [FATF report](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Virtual-Assets-Red-Flag-Indicators.pdf) highlighted last month in [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-14th---fatf-report-on-red-flag-indicators),  Associate Deputy Attorney General and Task Force chair [Sujit Raman](https://www.lawfareblog.com/contributors/sraman) argues that "decentralized platforms, peer-to-peer exchangers, and anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that use non-public or private blockchains all can further obscure financial transactions from legitimate scrutiny." Later on, under 'Ongoing Challenges and Future Strategies,' they warn that their acceptance of "may undermine the AML/CFT controls used to detect suspicious activity by MSBs and other financial institutions, and may limit or even negate a business’s ability to conduct AML/CFT checks on customer activity and to satisfy BSA requirements."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Some  AECs, however, offer features, such as public view keys, that potentially can facilitate the fulfillment of AML/CFT obligations, depending upon the implementation of such features.

Under the 'Threat Overview,' they note that "these are often referred to as 'anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies' ('AECs') or 'privacy coins.' Examples of AECs include Monero, Zcash, and Dash." Under 'Legitimate Uses,' they include generalised commentary from "cryptocurrency advocates" on the value of privacy:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Cryptocurrency advocates also stress that the privacy associated with cryptocurrency, though raising significant challenges for law enforcement, can have valid and beneficial uses. For example, such advocates claim that greater anonymity may reduce the risk of account or identity theft associated with the use of traditional credit systems.  

Under 'Department of Justice Response Strategies,' they claim that "some virtual currency exchanges have attempted to withhold data requested by law enforcement agencies," including through "criminal grand jury subpoenas," by invoking the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (GDPR). They believe that "such objections to lawful requests for information" are illegitimate.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> However, GDPR does not in fact bar companies subject to U.S. jurisdiction from complying with lawful requests in criminal investigations. To the contrary, GDPR explicitly permits the disclosure of data in a number of scenarios. For example, a virtual exchange that is subject to GDPR may process the requested data under GDPR Article 6(1) when "necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject" or "necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party....”<sup>[173](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679)</sup> Similarly, under Article 49.1, international transfer of data is permitted in various circumstances, including where "the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest" or "necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller.”<sup>174</sup>

Under the section on various cooperating agencies, they cite and summarise [FinCEN's guidance](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20CVC%20Guidance%20FINAL.pdf) that was highlighted in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-4th---europol-cybercrime-report-on-wasabi-wallet) regarding whether [anonymizing software providers](https://twitter.com/matt_odell/status/1314593241858269186) are required to register and comply with money transmitter laws.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In particular, the guidance outlined the application of FinCEN’s regulations to persons who provide anonymizing services or who are engaged in activities involving anonymity-enhanced CVCs. According to FinCEN, anonymizing service providers and some AEC issuers are money transmitters, whereas an individual or entity that merely provides anonymizing software is not.

On October 11th, Barr also appeared as a signatory on the "[International Statement: End-To-End Encryption and Public Safety](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety)," which seeks cooperation between technology companies and governments to "gain access to data in a readable and usable format" across "the range of encrypted services available, including device encryption, custom encrypted applications and encryption across integrated platforms."

## September 1st - S'MORE SCHNORR

[Pieter Wuille](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1300572711312265218) shared that [the pull-request](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/558) "for BIP340 (Schnorr signature) in libsecp256k1 is getting close to being mergeable," and encouraged others to perform final reviews. He is also the [co-author](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1300887053870092289) of a paper published on the same day titled "[MuSig-DN: Schnorr Multi-Signatures with Verifiably Deterministic Nonces](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1057)." This was [Wuille's last project](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1300852969173184514) as part of the [Blockstream Research](https://twitter.com/Blockstream/status/1301587578928402432) [team](https://medium.com/blockstream/musig-dn-schnorr-multisignatures-with-verifiably-deterministic-nonces-27424b5df9d6).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The resulting scheme, which we call MuSig-DN, is the first Schnorr multi-signature scheme with deterministic signing. Therefore its signing protocol is robust against failures in the randomness generation as well as attacks trying to exploit the statefulness of the signing procedure, e.g., virtual machine rewinding attacks... This makes it possible to realize MuSig-DN efficiently using zero-knowledge proof frameworks for arithmetic circuits which support inputs given in Pedersen commitments, e.g., Bulletproofs. We demonstrate the practicality of our technique by implementing it for the secp256k1 elliptic curve used in Bitcoin.

MuSig, the Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme this is based on, was originally proposed by [Gregory Maxwell](https://github.com/gmaxwell), [Andrew Poelstra](https://github.com/apoelstra), [Yannick Seurin](https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/author.php?authorkey=1078), and Wuille in January 2018, with "[Simple Schnorr Multi-Signatures with Applications to Bitcoin](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068)." They had explained the privacy benefits of using key and signature aggregation:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Key aggregation improves upon this further, as a single-key predicate can be used instead which is both smaller and has lower computational cost for verification. It also improves privacy, as the participant keys and their count remain private to the signers.
>
> ... The predicate in this case would take as input an aggregated public key, a signature with it, and a proof. Its validity would depend on the signature being valid with the provided key, and the proof establishing that the key is in fact one of the leaves of the Merkle tree, identified by its root hash. This approach is very generic, as it works for any subset of combinations of keys, and as a result has very good privacy as the exact policy is not visible from the proof.

There are also efficiency gains. On the same day, [Nadav Kohen](https://twitter.com/nadav_kohen) published "[Schnorr Applications: Batch Verification](https://suredbits.com/schnorr-applications-batch-verification/)," where he explains how "introducing a new standard for (Schnorr) signatures has allowed us to make design decisions that will enable what is called batch verification, which is a process in which many signatures can be verified at once in a process faster than verifying each signature individually."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On September 2nd, following last month’s meeting highlighted in [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-12th---schnorr-signaturecheckers), the [Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](https://twitter.com/BitcoinCorePRs/status/1299825428824285188) held their fifth meeting on BIP 340-342 developments. Hosted by [John Newberry](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery), they discussed Wuille's [pull-request on implementing Taproot validation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/a6ca5080c), which "uses an updated version of libsecp256k1 that requires the `--enable-module-schnorrsig` and `--enable-experimental` options." You can read the meeting log [here](https://bitcoincore.reviews/17977-3).

## September 2nd - EFF CALLS FOR COINBASE TRANSPARENCY REPORTS

[Legislative activist](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/hayley-tsukayama) [Hayley Tsukayama](https://twitter.com/htsuka) of the [**Electronic Frontier Foundation** (EFF)](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1301269804695789568) published [a call](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/its-past-time-coinbase-issue-transparency-reports) for Coinbase "to start releasing regular transparency reports that provide insight into how many government requests for information it receives, and how it deals with them." As they wrote back in [July 2018](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/five-policy-issues-blockchain-startups-care-about-user-rights-should-think-about), these transparency reports would provide "an overview of how many government requests the company received in a set period of time (such as a year)" and optionally "other details, such as how many requests it complied with, how many accounts were affected, and any requests to censor or take down accounts."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Financial data can be among the most sensitive types of information we produce. How you spend your money can reveal a lot about your daily habits, the causes you care about, who you hang out with, and where you go. Choosing to comply with or reject a government request for this user data—or choosing to shut down an account—can have a huge impact on what types of speech can thrive online.

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-15th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs), I featured the case [*U.S. v. Gratkowski*](http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/19/19-50492-CR0.pdf) in the context of law enforcement using the third-party doctrine to access financial data, including from cryptocurrency exchanges. The circuit judges decided that "Gratkowski thus lacked a privacy interest" in his Coinbase records. The EFF's special counsel [Marta Belcher](https://twitter.com/MartaBelcher/status/1285666397071212544) disagreed, arguing that the government's reliance on the third-party doctrine "[is wrong](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/appeals-court-decision-fails-protect-privacy-cryptocurrency-exchange-users)," and that exchanges should "fight for users' privacy."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Users should not lose their reasonable expectation of privacy in their data just because it is stored by a third party. In today’s digital world, it is almost impossible to navigate daily life without using essential services like email that give third parties access to sensitive information.

The [EFF](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1004403590012604416) had broadly called for [payment processors to start publishing transparency reports](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/its-time-payment-processors-stripe-and-paypal-start-publishing-transparency) back in June 2018, specifically calling on Bitpay and Coinbase. It was soon [reported](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1004517005389545475) that Coinbase [would say nothing on the matter](https://www.axios.com/stripe-plans-to-issue-transparency-reports-d12697fd-6b61-4d1e-ab1d-c3f54af6c765.html). Since then, [**ShapeShift**](https://twitter.com/ShapeShift_io/status/1086301806119006209) has published [one report](https://info.shapeshift.io/blog/2019/01/18/pulling-back-the-curtain-how-shapeshift-handles-law-enforcement-compliance/) for the year 2018. [**Kraken**](https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1214354510077820928) has published snapshots from two reports for the years 2018 and 2019.

Previous issues [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea) and [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-11th---coinbase-contracting-with-secret-service-irs) covered how Coinbase has recently established contractual relationships with the U.S. IRS, Secret Service, and [potentially](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/1270879061557067778) Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for their new blockchain analytics service.

## September 1st - S'MORE SCHNORR

[Pieter Wuille](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1300572711312265218) shared that [the pull-request](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/558) "for BIP340 (Schnorr signature) in libsecp256k1 is getting close to being mergeable," and encouraged others to perform final reviews. He is also the [co-author](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1300887053870092289) of a paper published on the same day titled "[MuSig-DN: Schnorr Multi-Signatures with Verifiably Deterministic Nonces](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1057)." This was [Wuille's last project](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1300852969173184514) as part of the [Blockstream Research](https://twitter.com/Blockstream/status/1301587578928402432) [team](https://medium.com/blockstream/musig-dn-schnorr-multisignatures-with-verifiably-deterministic-nonces-27424b5df9d6).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The resulting scheme, which we call MuSig-DN, is the first Schnorr multi-signature scheme with deterministic signing. Therefore its signing protocol is robust against failures in the randomness generation as well as attacks trying to exploit the statefulness of the signing procedure, e.g., virtual machine rewinding attacks... This makes it possible to realize MuSig-DN efficiently using zero-knowledge proof frameworks for arithmetic circuits which support inputs given in Pedersen commitments, e.g., Bulletproofs. We demonstrate the practicality of our technique by implementing it for the secp256k1 elliptic curve used in Bitcoin.

MuSig, the Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme this is based on, was originally proposed by [Gregory Maxwell](https://github.com/gmaxwell), [Andrew Poelstra](https://github.com/apoelstra), [Yannick Seurin](https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/author.php?authorkey=1078), and Wuille in January 2018, with "[Simple Schnorr Multi-Signatures with Applications to Bitcoin](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068)." They had explained the privacy benefits of using key and signature aggregation:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Key aggregation improves upon this further, as a single-key predicate can be used instead which is both smaller and has lower computational cost for verification. It also improves privacy, as the participant keys and their count remain private to the signers.
>
> ... The predicate in this case would take as input an aggregated public key, a signature with it, and a proof. Its validity would depend on the signature being valid with the provided key, and the proof establishing that the key is in fact one of the leaves of the Merkle tree, identified by its root hash. This approach is very generic, as it works for any subset of combinations of keys, and as a result has very good privacy as the exact policy is not visible from the proof.

There are also efficiency gains. On the same day, [Nadav Kohen](https://twitter.com/nadav_kohen) published "[Schnorr Applications: Batch Verification](https://suredbits.com/schnorr-applications-batch-verification/)," where he explains how "introducing a new standard for (Schnorr) signatures has allowed us to make design decisions that will enable what is called batch verification, which is a process in which many signatures can be verified at once in a process faster than verifying each signature individually."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On September 2nd, following last month’s meeting highlighted in [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-12th---schnorr-signaturecheckers), the [Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](https://twitter.com/BitcoinCorePRs/status/1299825428824285188) held their fifth meeting on BIP 340-342 developments. Hosted by [John Newberry](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery), they discussed Wuille's [pull-request on implementing Taproot validation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/a6ca5080c), which "uses an updated version of libsecp256k1 that requires the `--enable-module-schnorrsig` and `--enable-experimental` options." You can read the meeting log [here](https://bitcoincore.reviews/17977-3).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On September 11th, [Jonas Nick](https://twitter.com/n1ckler)'s [pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/558) to enable these experimental modules in [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1), Bitcoin Core's library for ECDSA signatures and other cryptographic operations on curve secp256k1, was finally [merged](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1304504395384512512) after [nearly two years of review](https://twitter.com/real_or_random/status/1304502818057969666).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

:information_source: Check out Kohen's "[Introduction to Schnorr Signatures](https://suredbits.com/introduction-to-schnorr-signatures/)," [Lucas Nuzzi](https://twitter.com/LucasNuzzi)'s "[Schnorr Signatures & The Inevitability of Privacy in Bitcoin](https://medium.com/digitalassetresearch/schnorr-signatures-the-inevitability-of-privacy-in-bitcoin-b2f45a1f7287)," and Bitcoin Optech's [Schnorr Taproot Workshop](https://bitcoinops.org/en/schorr-taproot-workshop/) to learn more.

## September 2nd - EFF CALLS FOR COINBASE TRANSPARENCY REPORTS

[Legislative activist](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/hayley-tsukayama) [Hayley Tsukayama](https://twitter.com/htsuka) of the [**Electronic Frontier Foundation** (EFF)](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1301269804695789568) published [a call](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/its-past-time-coinbase-issue-transparency-reports) for Coinbase "to start releasing regular transparency reports that provide insight into how many government requests for information it receives, and how it deals with them." As they wrote back in [July 2018](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/five-policy-issues-blockchain-startups-care-about-user-rights-should-think-about), these transparency reports would provide "an overview of how many government requests the company received in a set period of time (such as a year)" and optionally "other details, such as how many requests it complied with, how many accounts were affected, and any requests to censor or take down accounts."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Financial data can be among the most sensitive types of information we produce. How you spend your money can reveal a lot about your daily habits, the causes you care about, who you hang out with, and where you go. Choosing to comply with or reject a government request for this user data—or choosing to shut down an account—can have a huge impact on what types of speech can thrive online.

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-15th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs), I featured the case [*U.S. v. Gratkowski*](http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/19/19-50492-CR0.pdf) in the context of law enforcement using the third-party doctrine to access financial data, including from cryptocurrency exchanges. The circuit judges decided that "Gratkowski thus lacked a privacy interest" in his Coinbase records. The EFF's special counsel [Marta Belcher](https://twitter.com/MartaBelcher/status/1285666397071212544) disagreed, arguing that the government's reliance on the third-party doctrine "[is wrong](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/appeals-court-decision-fails-protect-privacy-cryptocurrency-exchange-users)," and that exchanges should "fight for users' privacy."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Users should not lose their reasonable expectation of privacy in their data just because it is stored by a third party. In today’s digital world, it is almost impossible to navigate daily life without using essential services like email that give third parties access to sensitive information.

The [EFF](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1004403590012604416) had broadly called for [payment processors to start publishing transparency reports](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/its-time-payment-processors-stripe-and-paypal-start-publishing-transparency) back in June 2018, specifically calling on Bitpay and Coinbase. It was soon [reported](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1004517005389545475) that Coinbase [would say nothing on the matter](https://www.axios.com/stripe-plans-to-issue-transparency-reports-d12697fd-6b61-4d1e-ab1d-c3f54af6c765.html). Since then, [**ShapeShift**](https://twitter.com/ShapeShift_io/status/1086301806119006209) has published [one report](https://info.shapeshift.io/blog/2019/01/18/pulling-back-the-curtain-how-shapeshift-handles-law-enforcement-compliance/) for the year 2018. [**Kraken**](https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1214354510077820928) has published snapshots from two reports for the years 2018 and 2019.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Previous issues [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea) and [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-11th---coinbase-contracting-with-secret-service-irs) covered how Coinbase has recently established contractual relationships with the U.S. IRS, Secret Service, and [potentially](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/1270879061557067778) Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for their new blockchain analytics service.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## September 4th - IRS STILL SEEKING TO TRACE PRIVACY COINS

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#june-30th---irs-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins-lightning), I highlighted a request for information from the IRS Cyber Crimes Unit (CCU) of the Criminal Investigation (CI) division regarding tracing tools for [privacy coins, Lightning, sidechains, and on-chain bitcoin using Schnorr signatures](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cryptocurrencytracing-rfifinal.pdf). It appears that no such thing exists and the request went unfulfilled, because they are now [soliticiting contractors](https://archive.is/DzWl2) to build it.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Their [request](https://web.archive.org/web/20200913075015/https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/pilotirscryptorfpfinal.pdf) states that they are "seeking a solution with one or more Contractors to provide innovative solutions for tracing and attribution of privacy coins and Layer 2 off-chain transactions" to "assist their Cyber Crimes agents in carrying their mission as it relates to cryptocurrency privacy technologies." The work would be carried out "under the overall direction of the Director of Cyber Crimes or their designee." The current CI chief is [Don Fort](https://www.irs.gov/about-irs/criminal-investigation-ci-at-a-glance), though he will be [replaced](https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/tax-compliance/news/21148720/james-lee-to-lead-irs-criminal-investigation-unit) by deputy director James Lee in October; the director of Cyber Crimes is [Michael T. Batdorf](https://www.cpaacademy.org/instructors/Michael-Batdorf).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

>  Pilot IRS will appear substantively different from how the government normally buys technology. To be fair, it is.

As primary goals, the document emphasizes that the tool must be able "to trace transaction inputs and outputs to a specific user and differentiate them from mixins/multisig actors" and produce "good statistical likelihoods of transaction parties," with "minimal involvement of external vendors." If a proposal is accepted before the [deadline](https://archive.is/DzWl2) of September 16th, then the applicant will be offered no more than $500,000 to develop "the proof of concept and an initial working system" within eight months. An additional $125,000 will be given for further "Testing and Pilot/Initial Deployment," suject to approval by the government.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## September 7th - IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON SECURITY AND PRIVACY

The [**Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers**](https://ieeesb.org/) (IEEE) hosted an all-digital academic conference on cryptocurrencies, with a track for "achieving and evaluating financial privacy in public blockchains." Privacy-focused talks included: [Sarah Meiklejohn](https://smeiklej.com/)'s "De-anonymizing Cryptocurrencies," [Suyash Bagad](https://twitter.com/BagadSuyash) and [Saravanan Vijayakumaran](https://twitter.com/sarva_v)'s "[Performance Trade-offs in Design of MimbleWimble Proofs of Reserves](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/938.pdf)," [Martin Westerkamp](https://www.snet.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/martin_westerkamp/) and [Jacob Eberhard](https://twitter.com/Jacob_Eberhardt)'s "[zkRelay: Facilitating Sidechains using zkSNARK-based Chain-Relays](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/433.pdf)," and [Sergei Tikhomirov](https://twitter.com/serg_tikhomirov), [Pedro Moreno-Sanchez](https://twitter.com/pedrorechez), and [Matteo Maffei](https://twitter.com/matteo_maffei)'s "[A Quantitative Analysis of Security, Anonymity and Scalability for the Lightning Network](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/303.pdf)." In case you missed the live event, videos and slides are available for almost all of the presentations.

## September 10th - NYM MIXNET TEST REWARDS IN BITCOIN

## September 13th - CHAINCASE BRINGS COINJOIN TO iPHONE

## September 14th - FATF REPORT ON 'RED FLAG INDICATORS'

The [**Financial Action Task Force**](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/virtual-assets-red-flag-indicators.html) (FATF) published a report on "[red flag indicators](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Virtual-Assets-Red-Flag-Indicators.pdf)" for virtual assets (VAs), which they believe will "help virtual asset service providers, financial institutions, and designated non-financial businesses and professions, and other reporting entities detect and report suspicious transactions."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Freestanding red flags such as those listed below can be developed or combined with information from operational agencies, which can in turn be further developed through a public-private partnership, in a cyclical, evolutionary process that takes into account the unique risk and context of a jurisdiction, customer type, or the reporting entity itself. The mere presence of a red flag indicator is not necessarily a basis for a suspicion of ML or TF, but could prompt further monitoring and examination.

The red flags are grouped into categories related to the "size and frequency of transactions," users "conducting a large initial deposit" and withdrawal, or "transactions involving the use of multiple VAs, or multiple accounts." They have a lengthy section on "technological features" that "increase anonymity and add hurdles to the detection of criminal activity," despite simultaneously asserting "the mere presence of these features in an activity does not automatically suggest an illicit transaction." In addition to monetary privacy-enhancing techniques such as "making use of mixing and tumbling services," "decentralised/unhosted, hardware or paper wallets to transport VAs across borders," and "VA ATMs/kiosks," the list also casts suspicion on "anonymous encrypted communication" in general.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## September 15th - FIDELITY'S CRYPTO PRIVACY CONFERENCE

The [**Fidelity Center for Applied Technology**](https://www.fidelity.com/fcatalyst/events/sept2020/crypto_privacy_conference) (FCAT) hosted a "two-day virtual conference featuring keynotes and panels addressing four major themes: bitcoin privacy, cryptography, financial privacy, and privacy-focused businesses." In case you missed the live event, hopefully the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/FidelityCenterforAppliedTechnology/videos) and slides will be published soon.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## September 16th - WASABI WALLET DEVELOPER MEETING

The Wasabi tream streamed their [developer meeting](https://youtu.be/6_v0bCR70_M?t=413).

## September 22nd - BLACKLIGHT WEBSITE PRIVACY INSPECTOR

[**The Markup**](https://themarkup.org/about), a non-profit media organisation led by [Julia Angwin](https://twitter.com/JuliaAngwin/status/1308346603498082304) that specialises in data-driven investigative journalism, has released a new tool called '[Blacklight: A Real-Time Website Privacy Inspector](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/).' Built by Brooklyn-based artist, engineer, and journalist [Surya Mattu](https://www.suryamattu.com), Blacklight scans whatever web address you specify and then generates short "inspection" reports regarding "specific user-tracking technologies on the site."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Some of the tracking technologies Blacklight scans for include: advertising trackers, third-party cookies, canvas fingerprinting, session recording services, keyloggers, Facebook Pixel, and Google Analytics' "remarketing audiences." If you are not already familiar with these techniques and how they impact your privacy, the report includes a simple explainer, whether or not they were found to be active on the particular website you specified, and whether they are using more than the "average" for popular sites. Note that it works by loading the homepage and one randomly selected page; different pages may have other results.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

This is not a Bitcoin-focused tool, but I thought it would be interesting to look at the privacy health of various cryptocurrency websites:

+ [Blockchain.info](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=www.blockchain.com): There are five advertising trackers from Facebook, Alphabet, and Twitter. Both Facebook Pixel and Google's 'remarketing audiences' feature are present.
+ [Blockstream.info](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=blockstream.info): Spotless!
+ [Casa](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=keys.casa): A nearly spotless result on all fronts, except for limited interaction with Amazon through Cloudfront.
+ [Chainalysis](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=www.chainalysis.com): There are six advertising trackers from LinkedIn, Alphabet, and Adobe; nine third-party cookies from LinkedIn and Adobe. Google's 'remarketing audiences' feature is present.
+ [Coinbase](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=www.coinbase.com): A few years ago, I had [highlighted](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/799775999936331776) that Coinbase appeared in [a study on cross-device tracking with browser fingerprinting](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/publications/article-2334.pdf). In addition to Facebook Pixel and canvas fingerprinting being present, this tool identified four advertising trackers from Facebook and Alphabet, and one third-party cookie from Alphabet. 
+ [CoinDesk](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=www.coindesk.com): There are five advertising trackers and one third-party cookie from Alphabet, including to DoubleClick.
+ [Decrypt](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=decrypt.co): There are eight advertising trackers from [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/), Alphabet, and Twitter; two third-party cookies from Alphabet. Both Facebook Pixel and Google's 'remarketing audiences' feature are present. There are also connections being made to Adobe's "typekit.net."
+ [Kraken](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=www.kraken.com): There are six advertising trackers from Alphabet, Reddit, and Microsoft; five third-party cookies from Reddit, Zendesk, and two other companies. Canvas fingerprinting and Google's 'remarketing audiences' feature are being used.
+ [Samourai](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=samouraiwallet.com): A nearly spotless result, except for one advertising tracker from Alphabet and limited interaction with Amazon via Cloudfront.
+ [Tales from the Crypto Podcast](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=tftc.io): A nearly spotless result, except for one advertising tracker from Alphabet.
+ [This Month in Bitcoin Privacy Newsletter](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=enegnei.github.io): Out of curiousity, I self-scanned. Spotless! :grin:
+ [Wasabi Wallet](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=www.wasabiwallet.io): A nearly spotless result, except for a key logger "loaded from algolia.net." As they explain in the report, key logging can be used non-maliciously for auto-completing search results, and Algolia is indeed a U.S.-based company that provides web search products. However it is unclear to me how the fields "name, family-name, given-name" would be relevant on this site.
+ [What Bitcoin Did](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=www.whatbitcoindid.com): This site had the most trackers and cookies compared to other examples here. There are seven advertising trackers from Adobe, Oracle, Alphabet, and Sumo Group. There are nineteen third-party cookies from Oracle, Amobee, Adobe, Alphabet, The Trade Desk, and WarnerMedia. Google's 'remarketing audiences' feature is present. There is also a connection being made to [MediaMath](https://www.mediamath.com/).
+ [Zcash / Electric Company Company](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=z.cash): There is one advertising tracker from Alphabet and one third-party cookie from [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) through the domains "newrelic.com" and "nr-data.net."
+ [Zcash Foundation](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=www.zfnd.org): Interestingly, there is a third-party cookie from Stripe, and they also appear to be allowing Stripe to engage in [canvas fingerprinting](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/1310243940663255042) on [their newsletter feed](https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/1310265084518645764). [An issue](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zfnd/issues/97) has since been opened to remove this unnecessary integration. There is a self-loaded key logging script that tracks the "email field" there as well, though this seems normal for a newsletter subscription page.

## September 24th - SAMOURAI OPENS BETA TESTING FOR SOROBAN

[**Samourai Wallet**](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1309211796021153795) published a demonstration of [Soroban](https://code.samourai.io/wallet/samourai-soroban), an in-development "method of facilitating blinded coordination and communication between multiple clients." They are currently working on refining it with "a small group of testers from our community" and registering interest through [Telegram](https://t.me/SamouraiWallet). On the same day, [version 1.8.0](https://code.samourai.io/dojo/samourai-dojo/-/blob/develop/RELEASES.md#1_8_0) of the Dojo was also [released](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1309175435708817418).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## September 26th - DIY COINJOINS WITH FULLY NODED

[Fully Noded](https://twitter.com/FullyNoded/status/1310075096950648832) published [a video](https://youtu.be/O_MS9LD9otI) on how to manually create your own CoinJoin-type transaction using [Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/psbt/) (PSBTs).

## March 1st - DISJOINTED: SERVICES FLAGGING MIXED COINS

**Bottlepay** user '[MartyB](https://twitter.com/Marty_P_B/status/1366737347887456260)' self-reported that they had "rejected my incoming btc transactions" based on analysis that they had been mixed through [Whirlpool](https://www.samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool). "If you have been sent mixed coins you will get stung." The message screenshot captured the service claiming they "unfortunately are unable to accept them due to the high percentage of the transactions having been through services used for coin mixing." [**Samourai Wallet**](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1366832754231570437) stated that "we have currently been unable to verify this report but are working hard to do so," and recommended using their [Ricochet](https://www.samouraiwallet.com/ricochet) feature. "We will use the information to design tools to route around their heuristics. We can move faster than they can if you communicate with us."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[**Bottlepay**](https://twitter.com/bottlepay/status/1367149002286858244) recently relaunched after raising £11 million in [seed funding](https://bottlepay.com/blog/global-payments-disruptor-bottlepay-raises-15-million) from "British fund manager Alan Howard, present and former Goldman Sachs partners, venture capital firm FinTech Collective, and financial services firm NYDIG and tech entrepreneur Phil Doye." They have not responded directly to the allegations, but a few days later they tweeted:

> What did we miss? 
>
> Bottlepay is a regulated business, focused on taking #bitcoin powered payments mainstream.
>
> We're operating within the framework as it currently stands, whilst constantly trying to bring positive change to it.

However, as lawyer [Rafael Yakobi](https://twitter.com/Deliver8tor/status/1234741063652233216) reminded **BlockFi** exactly one year ago, "You're following regulations that don't exist. Coinjoin is not illegal, nor is it suspicious without more evidence of the same."

On March 4th, researcher '[6102](https://twitter.com/6102bitcoin/status/1367376460214853632)' reported that **Bitstamp** Europe was "flagging coinjoins made with wasabi months/years AFTER withdrawal," and encouraged others to notify if they had a similar experience. On March 26th, **Wasabi** marketing strategist [Riccardo Masutti](https://twitter.com/RiccardoMasutti/status/1375507165151076353) self-reported that **Bitwala** "sent me an email 3 days ago about a couple of post-CoinJoin transactions that happened almost 6 MONTHS AGO."

> "These exchanges and services off-load their liability, oftentimes, to these chain surveillance companies. The chain surveillance companies give them risk scores. We know that some of the companies simply flag it as 'CoinJoin has happened' and 'this is a risky behaviour.' They are kind of admitting that they can't tell the difference between the overwhelmingly legitimate, law-abiding use of CoinJoin, and the illicit use, because it actually works! Instead of determining 'this is illicit' and 'this isn't illicit,' they respond by just trying to label it all as 'risky.' It shows how much improvement we've had in terms of Bitcoin privacy tools over the last two years."

Marty Bent and Matt Odell discussed this on [**Tales from the Crypt**](https://twitter.com/MartyBent/status/1367586686830587904) [Rabbit Hole Recap](https://anchor.fm/tales-from-the-crypt/episodes/Rabbit-Hole-Recap-Bitcoin-Week-of-2021-03-01-erj69g) (44:14 -- 1:08:23). Odell, who is an advisor to **Bottlepay**, said that a statement was forthcoming and that action was taken due to their interpretation of [the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018L0843) (AMLD5). In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-4th---europol-cybercrime-report-on-wasabi-wallet), I included a determination by **Europol**’s [European Cybercrime Centre](https://web.archive.org/web/20200606093325/https://www.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_5096130532387848318.pdf) (EC3) that AMLD5 "does not apply" to non-custodial wallets like **Wasabi**, and in [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-16th---know-your-customers-customer-kycc), I covered reluctant compliance among custodial European services.

## March 2nd - RECURRING TAPROOT MEETINGS

This month featured three Schnorr / Taproot activation-focused meetings via public IRC on [March 2nd](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018515.html), [16th](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018636.html), and [23rd](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018699.html). Russell O'Connor proposed a "[speedy trial](https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org/msg09604.html)" modified activation method that will "attempt to either quickly succeed or quickly fail -- without compromising safety in either case." During the [third](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018715.html) meeting, there was "broad agreement" that the client should be released by mid-May, and activation occur around block height 707616 or November 15th 2021.

## March 13th - LIGHTNING, DISCRETE LOG CONTRACTS, AND PRIVACY

In [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-6th---join-the-wasabikas), I highlighted the launch of a new podcast, hosted by [Max Hillebrand](https://twitter.com/HillebrandMax/status/1358050184228442120), titled “[Join the Wasabikas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPwc75tPMdsixsuhwau82Q0IfxECo0z_E)." This month, [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9p8uRkn8NY) [episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLwL9Hgz7QQ) focused on the privacy of Bitcoin ['smart' contracts](https://dci.mit.edu/smart-contracts) and the Lightning Network with [Chris Stewart](https://twitter.com/Chris_Stewart_5), [Nadav Kohen](https://twitter.com/nadav_kohen), and [István András Seres](https://twitter.com/Istvan_A_Seres). I have previously covered research on this topic in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-22nd---zkchannels-for-second-layer-privacy), [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-13th---junk-in-the-trunc-lightning-privacy), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-3rd---junk-in-the-trunc-lightning-privacy), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-7th---ieee-symposium-on-security-and-privacy), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-29th---like-a-clboss-lightning-privacy), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-3rd---privacy-in-cross-layer-interactions), and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-21st---empirical-analysis-of-lightning-privacy).

> "Happened stories are all alike, every unhappened story is unhappened in its own way... Can the past be resurrected or re-member-ed again? Should it be? And how much past can a person bear?"
>
> ― Georgi Gospodinov, "[Time Shelter](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books/time-shelter)" (2022)

> "[Jesse Thistle:] '.. I'm helping re-member. Not just remember, like a memory. Like re-member, reassemble this history that has been disembodied by the state and forgotten.'"

## August 2nd - FULL NODE DEEP DIVE: RONINDOJO

The [**Orange County (OC) Bitcoin Network**](https://www.meetup.com/oc-btc/), hosted by [Stephen Cole](https://twitter.com/sthenc) and [Brian Harrington](https://twitter.com/BrainHarrington), held their [fifth online event](https://youtu.be/ebv0aN8opIc) in a series exploring Bitcoin full node devices and software. This session, sponsored by [Bitcoin Magazine](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1289987717921562630), featured [RoninDojo](https://twitter.com/RoninDojoUI/status/1289591165298204673) developers [Zelko](https://twitter.com/BTCxZelko) and [Guerra Moneta](https://twitter.com/GuerraMoneta), who debuted their [new website](https://ronindojo.io/) during the stream. As I mentioned in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-7th---running-ronindojo), this is an installation assistant and user interface for [**Samourai Wallet**](https://samouraiwallet.com/dojo)'s self-hosted Dojo full node backend.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [This Bitcoin thing is a lot more than "number go up."](https://youtu.be/ebv0aN8opIc?t=4070)

Zelko and Guerra talked about how the project originated in the creation of Dojo [user](https://github.com/s2l1/Headless-Samourai-Dojo) [guides](https://github.com/BTCxZelko/Guides), which grew into an initiative to simplify and automate some of the processes involved as (eventually) a plug-and-play solution. They covered the [existing features](https://youtu.be/ebv0aN8opIc?t=1987) and explained why they made certain build decisions, such as not adding Lightning support. Zelko briefly discussed [a future premium offering](https://youtu.be/ebv0aN8opIc?t=2578) of RoninDojo for around $100 in order to sustain development. He gave [a live demonstration](https://youtu.be/ebv0aN8opIc?t=4463) of the GUI, designed by [Pavel Ševčík](https://twitter.com/pajasevi/status/1290038410598445056). For the last twenty minutes, they rolled through the roadmap, hardware specifications, and answered miscellaneous questions.

## August 4th - HRF GRANTS TO JOININBOX, ZEUS, FULLY NODED

In June, the [**Human Rights Foundation** (HRF)](https://hrf.org/) launched their ‘[Bitcoin Development Fund](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund),’ focused on “making the Bitcoin network more private, decentralized, and resilient." Their [next round](https://twitter.com/HRF/status/1290680292756332544) of grants, "1 bitcoin each, worth over $11,000 at the time of writing," has gone to "[JoinInbox](https://github.com/openoms/joininbox) creator [Openoms](https://twitter.com/openoms), [Zeus](https://zeusln.app/) creator [Evan Kaloudis](https://twitter.com/evankaloudis) and [Fully Noded](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fully-noded/id1436425586) creator [Fontaine](https://twitter.com/Fonta1n3)." As I covered in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-21st---introducing-joininbox), JoininBox is a graphical interface for the CoinJoin implementation [JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver), currently optimized to run on the [RaspiBlitz](https://shop.fulmo.org/raspiblitz/) full node.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> “The whole point of privacy is hiding in the crowd, and using JoinMarket as a maker required you to dwell deep in the command line,” Openoms, who’s also a contributor to the RaspiBlitz project, told [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-human-rights-foundation-awards-grants-to-three-more-bitcoin-projects). “By making it easier to be a maker, we can increase the liquidity and anonymity set available for CoinJoins significantly.”

[Zeus](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus) is a Lightning mobile app for iOS and Android via [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/), supporting connections to your own node over a VPN or Tor. Kaloudis' latest [v0.3.1](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/releases/tag/v0.3.1) release also enabled [multi-path payments](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/99ded495703be229dbe356db2859f2a72d9b0a9b/03_how_ln_works.asciidoc) (MPP) sending, a feature that was [added to LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta) at the end of April. As [**Lightning Labs'**](https://lightning.engineering/team/) protocol engineer [Joost Jager](https://twitter.com/joostjgr) [explained](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2020-05-07-mpp/), this comes with some privacy benefits:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> A final benefit of multi-path payments is that it obfuscates payment amounts. If a routing node is connected to a well-known source or destination of payments, it could guess at what the payment amount distribution looks like. Without the assumption that each payment consists of a single HTLC, the guessing becomes harder, enhancing privacy on the network.

[Christian Decker](https://twitter.com/Snyke) talked about [Point Timelock Contracts](https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-3-escrow-contracts/) (PTLCs), multi-path payments – which he had recently [implemented in c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/3809) – and privacy for [Livera's](https://twitter.com/stephanlivera/status/1293894462700023813) [SLP200](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/200/).

> (1:12:06) We are making traffic analysis a lot harder for ISP-level attackers. By really increasing the chattiness of the network itself, we make it much harder for observers to associate or to collate individual observations into one payment. It is definitely not the perfect solution, to tell a wider part of the network about a payment being done, but it is an incremental step towards the ultimate goal of making basically every payment indistinguishable from each other, which we are getting with Schnorr and the Point Timelock Contracts.
>
> Once we have the Point Timelock Contracts, we truly have a system where we are sending back-and-forth payments that are not collatable by payment hash, as you correctly pointed out. And not even by amount, because all of the payments have roughly the same amounts; it is the combination of multiple partial payments that gives you the actual transferred amount. It is not a clear loss or a clear win for privacy, that we're now telling a larger part of the network. But I do think that the pre-splitter and the adaptive splitting, combined with PTLCs, will be an absolute win no matter where you look at it.

## August 5th - PAYJOIN SUPPORT IN WASABI AND JOINMARKET

zkSNACKs released [1.1.12](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/releases/tag/v1.1.12) of [Wasabi Wallet](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1291057818536222725). In the release notes organized by CTO [David Molnar](https://twitter.com/molnardavid84/status/1290977265430548481), and the accompanying [blog post](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-wallet-1-1-12-is-out/) by marketing strategist [Riccardo Masutti](https://twitter.com/RiccardoMasutti), they note that a merchant-oriented implementation of [PayJoin](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/PayJoin.html) is now supported.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> **PayJoin is a collaborative transaction between the sender and the receiver** of a payment, for example the merchant and the customer. The goal of the protocol is to **break the common input ownership heuristic**, while making it difficult to fingerprint that the transaction is in fact a CoinJoin. Further, it reduces the transaction fees paid by the merchant due to the consolidation of coins.

On August 20th, [JoinMarket](https://twitter.com/joinmarket/status/1296540482156322816) released [0.7.0](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/releases/tag/v0.7.0), which also supports [PayJoin](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.7.0.md).

Otherwise known as [pay-to-end-point](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/PayJoin) (P2EP), this implementation – based on [Nicolas Dorier](https://twitter.com/NicolasDorier)'s [BIP-78](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki) – works with [BTCPay Server](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Payjoin/), and should be compatible with future releases of [Blockstream Green](https://www.blockstream.com/2020/04/16/en-bitcoin-privacy-improves-with-btcpay-servers-p2ep-implementation/) and [Blue Wallet](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/pull/1085). [Samourai](https://support.samourai.io/article/73-creating-a-stowaway-transaction) and [JoinMarket](https://github.com/Joinmarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/PAYJOIN.md) had already implemented their own versions of peer-to-peer PayJoin; there is [ongoing](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/150/) [discussion](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/149/) about how to make them all work together, so that users of different wallets can join their coins interoperably.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## August 8th - CROSS-CHAIN ATOMIC SWAPS WITH MONERO

Computer scientist and Monero researcher Joel '[h4sh3d](https://github.com/h4sh3d)' Gugger published a paper titled "[Bitcoin-Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap](https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf)." On July 31st, he had announced the completion of the research via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/i1fknt/ccs_results_monero_atomic_swaps_research/). He had made a funding request for 18 XMR back in May through the [Community Crowdfunding System (CCS)](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/h4sh3d-atomic-swap-research.html), though he notes that he started researching "a Bitcoin/Monero atomic swap three and a half years ago." Following review by the Monero Research Lab (MRL), the [announcement](https://twitter.com/monero/status/1290347500856115202) was shared widely on August 3rd.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> This protocol describes how to achieve atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Monero with two transactions per chain without trusting any central authority, servers, nor the other swap participant.

The paper remains purely technical, without making arguments about how swapping between Bitcoin and Monero benefits privacy. The introduction emphasizes that, being atomic, this will allow "two strangers to trade without risks nor the help of a third-party."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In the past, one of the most popular portals for swapping between these two cryptocurrencies was [**ShapeShift**](https://twitter.com/ShapeShift_io), the Denver-based crypto-to-crypto exchange. A [**Wall Street Journal**](https://archive.is/qe7Z9) investigation, which [accused them of money laundering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx0UAFY76W8&t=1978s), noted that "in the case of Monero, recipient addresses and transaction amounts remain secret and the trail is severed." Once ShapeShift [decided to discard their account-less model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx0UAFY76W8&t=1978s) and impose a requirement for [mandatory membership](https://info.shapeshift.io/blog/2018/09/04/introducing-shapeshift-membership/) in October 2018, following "[direct or indirect threats from regulators](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-shapeshift-erik-voorhees-kyc-proactive)," [trading volume in XMR/BTC](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/monero-price-analysis-consensus-algorithm-change-slated-for-october) was reported to be shifting towards decentralised exchanges like [Bisq](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1230292480551260165).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## August 9th - MALICIOUS TOR EXIT RELAYS

A security researcher and Tor server operator known as [Nusenu](https://nusenu.github.io/) published the first part of a report titled "[How Malicious Tor Relays are Exploiting Users in 2020](https://medium.com/@nusenu/how-malicious-tor-relays-are-exploiting-users-in-2020-part-i-1097575c0cac)." They claim to have "uncovered a malicious actor running more than 23% of the entire Tor network’s exit capacity," and that the attacker specifically targeted "cryptocurrency related websites — namely multiple bitcoin mixer services."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> They replaced bitcoin addresses in HTTP traffic to redirect transactions to their wallets instead of the user provided bitcoin address. Bitcoin address rewriting attacks are not new, but the scale of their operations is.

They explain that the attacker engaged in selective [SSL stripping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike#SSL_stripping), removing "HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects to gain full access to plain unencrypted HTTP traffic." Websites that do not use "established countermeasures, namely [HSTS Preloading](https://hstspreload.org/) and [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)," make this attack possible, and it is "not specific to Tor Browser. Malicious relays are just used to gain access to user traffic." [**ZDNet**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-mysterious-group-has-hijacked-tor-exit-nodes-to-perform-ssl-stripping-attacks/) noted that a similar attack using Tor-to-web proxies had been performed in 2018; computer scientist [Neal Krawetz](https://www.hackerfactor.com/about.php) pointed to [an earlier attack from 2014](https://twitter.com/hackerfactor/status/1292802644659052546). Nusenu did not report which mixing services were targeted and how much, if any, bitcoin was successfully hijacked this way.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[Fully Noded](https://twitter.com/FullyNoded/status/1293540826350415872) clarified that they were not affected, and [Wasabi](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1293898875334537217) published a blog post in more detail about why "[replacement attacks are not possible due to the architecture of Wasabi](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-wallet-tor-ssl-stripping-attack/)." But these attacks do highlight the value of features like [Onion-Location](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-8th---hyperonionization), helping users to stay within the Tor network, rather than relying on exit nodes to access clearnet content.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## August 11th - DESIGN SKETCH FOR FIRST VERSION OF COINSWAP

After announcing that he was creating [an implementation of CoinSwap](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964) in May and receiving [a grant](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund) for that work in June, Chris Belcher emailed [a more detailed design sketch](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-August/018080.html) to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> This document describes the first version of the protocol which implements multi-transaction Coinswap, routed Coinswap, fidelity bonds, a liquidity market and private key handover.

We [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3rehVW_hDk) Belcher about this on August 10th.

## August 12th - SCHNORR SIGNATURECHECKERS

Following last month's meeting highlighted in [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-24th---schnorr--taproot-activation), the [Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](https://twitter.com/BitcoinCorePRs/status/1291845907512786946) held their fourth meeting, hosted by [John Newberry](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery), to discuss "[support for Schnorr signatures and integration in SignatureCheckers](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/125318b68a)." You can read the meeting log [here](https://bitcoincore.reviews/17977-2).

## August 18th - DUST ATTACKS

[**CoinDesk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1295753495195324416) journalist [Colin Harper](https://twitter.com/AsILayHodling) reported on [an ongoing dust attack](https://www.coindesk.com/dust-attacks-bitcoin-wallets) that started around August 4th, attributed to "an entity that appears to be advertising an obscure Bitcoin SV messaging application," [Memo SV](https://web.archive.org/web/20200520111735/https://memo.sv/). Days earlier, [Samourai Wallet](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1293657948280033281) had dubbed this "the most organized dusting we have seen for some time."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

As [explained](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/10986/what-is-meant-by-bitcoin-dust) elsewhere by [Murch](https://twitter.com/murchandamus) and [Yahiheb](https://twitter.com/yahiheb_), "The definition of dust is client-specific and not a network rule. Bitcoin Core considers a transaction output to be dust, when its value is lower than the cost of spending it." While receiving a tiny amount of free money may sound harmless, dust can cause a variety of problems, even for custodial wallet users. Following [the acquisition of Neutrino last year](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea), some Coinbase customers who sought to leave the service encountered a [Catch-22](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catch-22): closing your account [requires having zero remaining balance](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/managing-my-account/account-information/how-can-i-close-my-account), but if you had a "dust balance," i.e. an amount too small to be withdrawn, you were stuck. These frustrated customers [developed a work-around](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1100864154443776000), [passing along their dust balances to each other](https://breakermag.com/why-crypto-twitter-is-on-fire-with-deletecoinbase/) via Coinbase's internal account system, until the amount was large enough to finally be withdrawn.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Dust also has privacy consequences. In March 2019, [Ádám 'Nopara' Ficsór](https://twitter.com/nopara73/status/1105779583410946049) noted that Wasabi wallet users were being dusted. In an attempt to make the dust economical, bitcoin users will often consolidate them together during low-fee periods, which can result in multiple addresses becoming linked to a common owner. "About half of them don't mind joining together some of their dusts, exposing the links between their mixed outputs (not the mixes though)." During that week's [**Tales from the Crypt**](https://twitter.com/MartyBent/status/1106241188628189185) [Rabbit Hole Recap](https://anchor.fm/tales-from-the-crypt/episodes/Rabbit-Hole-Recap-Week-of-2019-03-11-e3f6ef), he said he did not know what the attackers were trying to achieve, but the dust had been interfering with their ability to accurately measure the anonymity set. Since their [1.1.3](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/releases/tag/v1.1.3) release, as a countermeasure, the wallet automatically hides / separates UTXOs which are less than or equal to 0.0001BTC from spendable coins.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[Ergo](https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1293273159165267977), an analyst for Samourai's "[separate, yet complimentary](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/168785913782/samourai-oxt)" visualization and publication platform [OXT Research](https://www.oxtresearch.com/), has been sharing data points on this latest 'promotional dusting' behaviour since August 11th. He claims to have "traced some 84,000 dust outputs from 146 transactions," and thinks that raising the dust limit may act as "a deterrent." Others have suggested revitalising [coin management tools](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1293659464634073096) that can deal with these UTXOs in a privacy-preserving way, such as Peter Todd's '[Dust-B-Gone](https://github.com/petertodd/dust-b-gone).' Since November 2017, [Samourai Wallet](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/167306611667/wallet-update-097-coin-control-dust-tx-alerts) has had a "Dust Alerting" feature and allowed their users to label any UTXO as 'Do Not Spend.'
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

And while there are currently no grounds to believe that the culprit behind this dust attack was either a malicious chain analytics company or exchange, Harper highlighted why such actors could be motivated to pull an attack like this.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> CoinDesk reached out to Chainalysis and CipherTrace to ask if they use dust in their analytics. Both companies denied using this technique, though Chainalysis Manager of Investigation Justin Maile added that dusting is “more often [used] by investigators” to trace illicit funds. Maile continued that exchanges may use dusting to trace stolen funds following a hack.
>
> Dave Jevans, the CEO of blockchain analytics company CipherTrace, told CoinDesk that “hackers may use dusting as a strategy for identifying individuals who can then be phished or extorted.”

## August 20th - DIRTCOIN DIARIES' PAYNYM TORCH

The [Bitcoin Enemies](https://bitcoinenemies.com/) virtual meetup hosted their second session of '[Dirtcoin Diaries](https://twitter.com/biTcOinEneMiEs/status/1295004118516342786)' group discussion, with a focus on [PayNyms](https://support.samourai.io/section/32-paynym). In the four days leading up to the meeting, they had [organised](https://twitter.com/biTcOinEneMiEs/status/1295005099371028480) a [PayNym torch](https://twitter.com/i/events/1295315096445411329) with proceeds going to support development of [RoninDojo](https://twitter.com/RoninDojoUI/status/1296532321118507008).

[PayNyms](https://support.samourai.io/article/68-what-are-paynyms) are an implementation of [BIP-47](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki), which specifies creating "a payment code which can be publicly advertised and associated with a real-life identity without creating the loss of security or privacy inherent to P2PKH address reuse." Instead of publishing a single donation address that all donors send money to, you share a pseudonymous identity (representing the payment code) that can be used to generate a fresh address for each payment. Not only can this obscure your donation address to the public, as each donor will only know the particular receive address they've paid to, but it significantly reduces address reuse.

During the [meetup](https://twitter.com/biTcOinEneMiEs/status/1296515405477851136), they talked about why BIP-47 hasn't been more widely adopted yet, how complex it is under the surface, and strategies for using coins received through PayNyms. [Samourai Wallet](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet) reported that 82,800 PayNyms have been registered so far in [their directory](https://paynym.is/).

The idea for a PayNym torch originated in issues with last year's [Lightning Torch](https://web.archive.org/web/20191217074307/https://takethetorch.online/Torch) event, a fun way to test the capacity of the Lightning Network. While this transaction relay was being described as "[a worldwide marathon](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/lightning-torchs-bitcoin-payment-is-running-a-worldwide-marathon)," American participants were shy about [passing the torch to those living in parts of the world under U.S. sanctions](https://twitter.com/real_vijay/status/1099867809889214464). On February 26th 2019, [OXT](https://twitter.com/oxt_btc) developer and researcher [Laurent](https://twitter.com/LaurentMT/status/1100496030267789312) initiated a PayNym torch with Iranian bitcoiner [Ziya Sadr](https://twitter.com/Ziya_Sadr/status/1100526665275506689). Similar to the Lightning torch, whoever [received the PayNym torch](https://twitter.com/brian_trollz/status/1100540426602336263) would add a small amount, 0.001 BTC, and then pass it on to another PayNym of their choice.

## August 21st - THE SOLUTION TO SIM SWAPPING?

**Chainalysis** public sector outreach and sales engineer Scott Johnston [published an article](https://twitter.com/UKFtweets/status/1296831886346653696) to the blog of [**UK Finance**](https://twitter.com/UKFtweets), a three-year-old trade association and lobbying group representing the UK banking and financial services sector. The piece, aimed at "compliance professionals and financial investigators," is titled "[How to fight back against SIM swapping with blockchain analysis](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/blogs/how-fight-back-against-sim-swapping-blockchain-analysis)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In cases involving stolen cryptocurrency, they can use blockchain analysis to trace stolen funds to a cryptocurrency service they can subpoena for information on the attacker. [An example of this is on our blog](http://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/sim-swap-attacks), from a recent SIM swapping attack we investigated in which the victim had roughly $25,000 worth of cryptocurrency stolen. The attacker moves the funds through several intermediary wallets before depositing them across several different cryptocurrency services including exchanges, merchant services providers and darknet markets.

If the problem of SIM swapping was a weed, then applying blockchain analysis would be like trimming some leaves: this does nothing to address any of the root causes. Low-paid mobile service provider employees and contractors who are easy to socially engineer. Poor security controls and protocols on the porting of numbers to new devices. [Fundamental weaknesses in mobile network security](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/859913918122274821). Widespread misuse of phone numbers as identifiers, when the user doesn't actually control them. Data brokers having easy access to personally identifying mobile subscription and GPS data that is abused for everything from [extra-legal tax investigations](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea) to [stalking](https://www.fastcompany.com/90310803/here-are-the-data-brokers-quietly-buying-and-selling-your-personal-information) to [extra-judicial drone strikes](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/813784796505735168).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

It is concerning that people with potential influence in the UK government would be giving out advice that more financial surveillance and control is the solution to this problem. But it would also be unsurprisng given [their trajectory of recent years](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/557861/IP_Bill_-_Draft_EI_code_of_practice.pdf), handicapping individual privacy and safety in favour of a surveillance state that has repeatedly [failed to deliver](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/21/reading-stabbings-libyan-held-after-three-killed-in-park-attack) on its promises of so-called national security.

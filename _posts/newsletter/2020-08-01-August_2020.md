## August 2nd - FULL NODE DEEP DIVE: RONINDOJO

The [**Orange County (OC) Bitcoin Network**](https://www.meetup.com/oc-btc/), hosted by [Stephen Cole](https://twitter.com/sthenc) and [Brian Harrington](https://twitter.com/BrainHarrington), held their [fifth online event](https://youtu.be/ebv0aN8opIc) in a series exploring Bitcoin full node devices and software. This session, sponsored by [Bitcoin Magazine](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1289987717921562630), featured [RoninDojo](https://twitter.com/RoninDojoUI/status/1289591165298204673) developers [Zelko](https://twitter.com/BTCxZelko) and [Guerra Moneta](https://twitter.com/GuerraMoneta), who debuted their [new website](https://ronindojo.io/) during the stream. As I mentioned in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-7th---running-ronindojo), this is an installation assistant and user interface for [**Samourai Wallet**](https://samouraiwallet.com/dojo)'s self-hosted Dojo full node backend.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [This Bitcoin thing is a lot more than "number go up."](https://youtu.be/ebv0aN8opIc?t=4070)

Zelko and Guerra talked about how the project originated in the creation of Dojo [user](https://github.com/s2l1/Headless-Samourai-Dojo) [guides](https://github.com/BTCxZelko/Guides), which grew into an initiative to simplify and automate some of the processes involved as (eventually) a plug-and-play solution. They covered the [existing features](https://youtu.be/ebv0aN8opIc?t=1987) and explained why they made certain build decisions, such as not adding Lightning support. Zelko briefly discussed [a future premium offering](https://youtu.be/ebv0aN8opIc?t=2578) of RoninDojo for around $100 in order to sustain development. He gave [a live demonstration](https://youtu.be/ebv0aN8opIc?t=4463) of the GUI, designed by [Pavel Ševčík](https://twitter.com/pajasevi/status/1290038410598445056). For the last twenty minutes, they rolled through the roadmap, hardware specifications, and answered miscellaneous questions.

## August 4th - HRF GRANTS TO JOININBOX, ZEUS, FULLY NODED

In June, the [**Human Rights Foundation** (HRF)](https://hrf.org/) launched their ‘[Bitcoin Development Fund](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund),’ focused on “making the Bitcoin network more private, decentralized, and resilient." Their [next round](https://twitter.com/HRF/status/1290680292756332544) of grants, "1 bitcoin each, worth over $11,000 at the time of writing," has gone to "[JoinInbox](https://github.com/openoms/joininbox) creator [Openoms](https://twitter.com/openoms), [Zeus](https://zeusln.app/) creator [Evan Kaloudis](https://twitter.com/evankaloudis) and [Fully Noded](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fully-noded/id1436425586) creator [Fontaine](https://twitter.com/Fonta1n3)." As I covered in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-21st---introducing-joininbox), JoininBox is a graphical interface for the CoinJoin implementation [JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver), currently optimized to run on the [RaspiBlitz](https://shop.fulmo.org/raspiblitz/) full node.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> “The whole point of privacy is hiding in the crowd, and using JoinMarket as a maker required you to dwell deep in the command line,” Openoms, who’s also a contributor to the RaspiBlitz project, told [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-human-rights-foundation-awards-grants-to-three-more-bitcoin-projects). “By making it easier to be a maker, we can increase the liquidity and anonymity set available for CoinJoins significantly.”

[Zeus](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus) is a Lightning mobile app for iOS and Android via [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/), supporting connections to your own node over a VPN or Tor. Kaloudis' latest [v0.3.1](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/releases/tag/v0.3.1) release also enabled [multi-path payments](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/99ded495703be229dbe356db2859f2a72d9b0a9b/03_how_ln_works.asciidoc) (MPP) sending, a feature that was [added to LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta) at the end of April. As [**Lightning Labs'**](https://lightning.engineering/team/) protocol engineer [Joost Jager](https://twitter.com/joostjgr) [explained](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2020-05-07-mpp/), this comes with some privacy benefits:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> A final benefit of multi-path payments is that it obfuscates payment amounts. If a routing node is connected to a well-known source or destination of payments, it could guess at what the payment amount distribution looks like. Without the assumption that each payment consists of a single HTLC, the guessing becomes harder, enhancing privacy on the network.

[Christian Decker](https://twitter.com/Snyke) talked about [Point Timelock Contracts](https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-3-escrow-contracts/) (PTLCs), multi-path payments – which he had recently [implemented in c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/3809) – and privacy for [Livera's](https://twitter.com/stephanlivera/status/1293894462700023813) [SLP200](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/200/).

> (1:12:06) We are making traffic analysis a lot harder for ISP-level attackers. By really increasing the chattiness of the network itself, we make it much harder for observers to associate or to collate individual observations into one payment. It is definitely not the perfect solution, to tell a wider part of the network about a payment being done, but it is an incremental step towards the ultimate goal of making basically every payment indistinguishable from each other, which we are getting with Schnorr and the Point Timelock Contracts.
>
> Once we have the Point Timelock Contracts, we truly have a system where we are sending back-and-forth payments that are not collatable by payment hash, as you correctly pointed out. And not even by amount, because all of the payments have roughly the same amounts; it is the combination of multiple partial payments that gives you the actual transferred amount. It is not a clear loss or a clear win for privacy, that we're now telling a larger part of the network. But I do think that the pre-splitter and the adaptive splitting, combined with PTLCs, will be an absolute win no matter where you look at it.

## August 5th - PAYJOIN SUPPORT IN WASABI

zkSNACKs released [1.1.12](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/releases/tag/v1.1.12) of [Wasabi Wallet](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1291057818536222725). In the release notes organized by CTO [David Molnar](https://twitter.com/molnardavid84/status/1290977265430548481), and the accompanying [blog post](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-wallet-1-1-12-is-out/) by marketing strategist [Riccardo Masutti](https://twitter.com/RiccardoMasutti), they note that a merchant-oriented implementation of [PayJoin](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/PayJoin.html) is now supported.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> **PayJoin is a collaborative transaction between the sender and the receiver** of a payment, for example the merchant and the customer. The goal of the protocol is to **break the common input ownership heuristic**, while making it difficult to fingerprint that the transaction is in fact a CoinJoin. Further, it reduces the transaction fees paid by the merchant due to the consolidation of coins.

Otherwise known as [pay-to-end-point](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/PayJoin) (P2EP), this implementation, based on [Nicolas Dorier](https://twitter.com/NicolasDorier)'s [BIP-78](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki), works with [BTCPay Server](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Payjoin/), and should be compatible with future releases of [Blockstream Green](https://www.blockstream.com/2020/04/16/en-bitcoin-privacy-improves-with-btcpay-servers-p2ep-implementation/) and [Blue Wallet](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/pull/1085). Ahead of the pack, [Samourai](https://support.samourai.io/article/73-creating-a-stowaway-transaction) and [JoinMarket](https://github.com/Joinmarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/PAYJOIN.md) had already implemented their own versions of peer-to-peer PayJoin, and there is [ongoing](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/150/) [discussion](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/149/) about how / whether to make them all work together.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## August 8th - CROSS-CHAIN ATOMIC SWAPS WITH MONERO

Computer scientist and Monero researcher Joel '[h4sh3d](https://github.com/h4sh3d)' Gugger published a paper titled "[Bitcoin-Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap](https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf)." On July 31st, he had announced the completion of the research via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/i1fknt/ccs_results_monero_atomic_swaps_research/). He had made a funding request for 18 XMR back in May through the [Community Crowdfunding System (CCS)](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/h4sh3d-atomic-swap-research.html), though he notes that he started researching "a Bitcoin/Monero atomic swap three and a half years ago." Following review by the Monero Research Lab (MRL), the [announcement](https://twitter.com/monero/status/1290347500856115202) was shared widely on August 3rd.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> This protocol describes how to achieve atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Monero with two transactions per chain without trusting any central authority, servers, nor the other swap participant.

The paper remains purely technical, without making arguments about how swapping between Bitcoin and Monero benefits privacy. The introduction emphasizes that, being atomic, this will allow "two strangers to trade without risks nor the help of a third-party."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In the past, one of the most popular portals for swapping between these two cryptocurrencies was [**ShapeShift**](https://twitter.com/ShapeShift_io), a Denver-based crypto-to-crypto exchange. A [**Wall Street Journal**](https://archive.is/qe7Z9) investigation, which [accused them of money laundering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx0UAFY76W8&t=1978s), noted that "in the case of Monero, recipient addresses and transaction amounts remain secret and the trail is severed." Once ShapeShift [decided to discard their account-less model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx0UAFY76W8&t=1978s) and impose a requirement for [mandatory membership](https://info.shapeshift.io/blog/2018/09/04/introducing-shapeshift-membership/) in October 2018, following "[direct or indirect threats from regulators](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-shapeshift-erik-voorhees-kyc-proactive)," [trading volume in XMR/BTC](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/monero-price-analysis-consensus-algorithm-change-slated-for-october) was reported to be shifting towards decentralised exchanges like [Bisq](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1230292480551260165).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## August 9th - MALICIOUS TOR EXIT RELAYS

A security researcher and Tor server operator known as [Nusenu](https://nusenu.github.io/) published the first part of a report titled "[How Malicious Tor Relays are Exploiting Users in 2020](https://medium.com/@nusenu/how-malicious-tor-relays-are-exploiting-users-in-2020-part-i-1097575c0cac)." They claim to have "uncovered a malicious actor running more than 23% of the entire Tor network’s exit capacity," and that the attacker specifically targeted "cryptocurrency related websites — namely multiple bitcoin mixer services."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> They replaced bitcoin addresses in HTTP traffic to redirect transactions to their wallets instead of the user provided bitcoin address. Bitcoin address rewriting attacks are not new, but the scale of their operations is.

They explain that the attacker engaged in selective [SSL stripping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike#SSL_stripping), removing "HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects to gain full access to plain unencrypted HTTP traffic." Websites that do not use "established countermeasures, namely [HSTS Preloading](https://hstspreload.org/) and [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)," make this attack possible, and it is "not specific to Tor Browser. Malicious relays are just used to gain access to user traffic." Nusenu did not report which mixing services were targeted and how much, if any, bitcoin was successfully hijacked this way.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[Fully Noded](https://twitter.com/FullyNoded/status/1293540826350415872) clarified that they were not affected, and [Wasabi](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1293898875334537217) published a blog post in more detail about why "[replacement attacks are not possible due to the architecture of Wasabi](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-wallet-tor-ssl-stripping-attack/)."

[**ZDNet**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-mysterious-group-has-hijacked-tor-exit-nodes-to-perform-ssl-stripping-attacks/) noted that a similar type of attack had been performed in 2018.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## August 11th - DESIGN SKETCH FOR FIRST VERSION OF COINSWAP

After announcing that he was creating [an implementation of CoinSwap](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964) in May and receiving [a grant](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund) for that work in June, Chris Belcher emailed [a more detailed design sketch](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-August/018080.html) to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> This document describes the first version of the protocol which implements multi-transaction Coinswap, routed Coinswap, fidelity bonds, a liquidity market and private key handover.

We [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3rehVW_hDk) Belcher about this on August 10th.

## August 12th - SCHNORR SIGNATURECHECKERS

Following last month's meeting highlighted in [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-24th---schnorr--taproot-activation), the [Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](https://twitter.com/BitcoinCorePRs/status/1291845907512786946) held their fourth meeting, hosted by [John Newberry](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery), to discuss "[support for Schnorr signatures and integration in SignatureCheckers](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/125318b68a)." You can read the meeting log [here](https://bitcoincore.reviews/17977-2).

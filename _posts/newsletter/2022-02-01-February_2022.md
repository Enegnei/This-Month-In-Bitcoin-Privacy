*"Imagine, a newsletter so private, it doesn't even hit your inbox for three months..." This section is for important stories that would have been included in newsletters during the November-January hiatus.*

+ On October 22nd 2021, the [Cryptoeconomic Systems (CES) Journal](https://twitter.com/CryptoEconSys/status/1455290496780156928), housed by MIT's [Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu/) (DCI) published their [second issue](https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/vol1-2) with ten review summaries of various papers, including the [WabiSabi](https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/pub/ficsor-wabisabi-coordinated-review/release/1?readingCollection=a1e776d2) paper ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-11th---wabisabi-and-coinpool), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-19th---oxt-research-vulnerability-disclosure), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-5th---wasabi-wallet-20), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-6th---join-the-wasabikas), [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-7th---wasabi-wallet-20-update-continued), and [TMIBP16](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2021/#august-31st---wasabi-wallet-20-update-continued)).

+ On November 2nd 2021, Stephan Livera published [an interview](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/318/) with [Dr Ronald F. Pol](https://www.effectiveaml.org/ron/) ([@ronaldpol](https://twitter.com/ronaldpol)), an anti-money laundering (AML) researcher and former lawyer. They discussed his paper, "[Anti-Money Laundering: The World's Least Effective Policy Experiment? Together, We Can Fix It](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339486326_Anti-money_laundering_The_world's_least_effective_policy_experiment_Together_we_can_fix_it)," from February 2020 ([TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework)). He argues that "the modern anti-money laundering experiment unwittingly enables, protects and supports terrorists, drug, human, arms and wildlife traffickers, sex and labor exploiters, and corrupt officials, fraudsters and tax evaders on a global scale."

> There is an underlying assumption that KYC is good, that we need identification, we need all sorts of identification... And certainly there are privacy people who are putting up a good argument in a number of areas, but what’s often missing from that is — it’s a belief that KYC is good. Let’s test that assumption. Do we need all of this KYC, or could we do some of it that actually has an impact?

+ In the area of Lightning Network privacy, [**ACINQ**](https://acinq.co/) software developer [Bastien Teinturier](https://twitter.com/realtbast) was interviewed in [SLP319](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/319/) about its shortcomings and opportunities for improvement, such as Taproot/Schnorr, MuSig ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-11th---design-sketch-for-first-version-of-coinswap), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-1st---smore-schnorr), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-14th---smore-schnorr-and-tapscript), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-4th---musig2), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-15th---taproot-activation-specification-merged), and [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-12th---taproot-locked-in)), [route blinding](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/765), payment decorrelation, and Trampoline routing ([TMBIP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-30th---electrum-supports-trampoline-routing)). Teinturier also spoke on these topics, [independently](https://youtu.be/gOiKlx9a1xg) and [on a panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UYdyzCyO0c), for the [**Adopting Bitcoin** (AB21) conference](https://adoptingbitcoin.org/speaker/BastienTeinturier/) in El Salvador. On December 19th, [**Chainalysis**](https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1469317238893289475) announced that they were "[the first blockchain analysis company to offer customers a transaction monitoring solution for the Lightning Network](https://archive.fo/3oeSD)," claiming that "our customers will be able to use KYT to monitor their Lighting Network transactions, screen for risky activity, and gain valuable insights." This was discussed at length in the [Lightning Junkies](https://twitter.com/LNJunkies/status/1470542207329263616) [podcast](https://lightningjunkies.net/chainalysis-on-lightning-network-lightningfriday-12-17-2021-with-jestopher-and-chaz/) on December 17th.

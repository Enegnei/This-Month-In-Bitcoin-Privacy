## OVERFLOW

**"Imagine, a newsletter so private, it doesn't even hit your inbox for three months."** *This section is for important stories that would have been included in newsletters during the November-January hiatus.*

#### Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP)

As I covered in the last [TMIBP17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-1st---fatf-travel-rule-updates), the **Financial Action Task Force** (FATF) finalised and published their [updated guidance for virtual asset service providers](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html) (VASPs) at the end of October. Back in November 2020 ([TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-16th---know-your-customers-customer-kycc)), I also covered the emergence of KYCC polices in the Netherlands and Switzerland that required customers of such obliged entities to somehow confirm the ownership of deposit or withdrawal addresses. Meanwhile, the Swiss-based "[compliance and data protection](https://www.21analytics.ch/about/)" company **21 Analytics** has written about the various ways to perform "[non-custodial address ownership proof](https://www.21analytics.ch/blog/the-hassle-of-travel-rule-transacting-with-non-custodial-wallets/)," given inconsistent compliance between countries. On January 18th 2022, they published [a similar blog post](https://www.21analytics.ch/blog/unhosted-wallet-verification-methods-an-overview/), but with heavier emphasis on and promotion of their new [Address Ownership Proof Protocol](https://aopp.group/) (AOPP) for [Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://gitlab.com/aopp/address-ownership-proof-protocol/-/blob/master/README.md) addresses, which they claimed was "already supported by BitBox, BlueWallet, Sparrow, and others. Work is underway to add AOPP support to Trezor and Ledger." (Interestingly, two days later, they also wrote about development of their [OpenSanctions](https://www.21analytics.ch/blog/opensanctions-fair-affordable-and-privacy-preserving-pep-sanction-checking-compliance/) product.)
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Two weeks earlier, **Trezor** had explained how to use their 'Sign & Verify' feature to "[send [a] message, address and signature to whomever requested proof of ownership](https://blog.trezor.io/how-to-prove-ownership-of-your-keys-and-keep-them-safe-f566ec5664c8)," though this was not identified as AOPP or even marketed as a compliance tool. Indeed, in and of itself, the ability to create and verify digitally signed messages is a basic function of [public key cryptography](https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html#pkc) systems, and could be used for integrity checks in a pure peer-to-peer context. However, on January 19th, they confirmed that the AOPP-specific proof format had been integrated into the Suite interface, "[saving time when dealing with some jurisdictions’ regulations](https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-suite-and-trezor-model-one-firmware-updates-january-2022-4a77e4a07a5a)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Following this [explicit association](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/27/trezor-adopts-swiss-travel-rule-protocol-for-private-crypto-wallets/) with [Travel Rule compliance](https://www.21analytics.ch/21-travel-rule-solution/), **Samourai Wallet** and others argued that "[by buying into this system you are legitimizing the concept that self custody requires permission & compliance](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1486771414761971715)." **Trezor** [initially](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1486747863912796171) [defended](https://twitter.com/slush/status/1486738933824241665) the decision, pointing out that "the message for signing is composed of information already available to the exchange." On January 28th, [they](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1487091879883722755) and a [few](https://twitter.com/bluewalletio/status/1486805550608392194) [other](https://twitter.com/SparrowWallet/status/1486785866739728386) wallets reversed the changes:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [As a proudly independent company, our decisions are always made in support of individuals. In this case, AOPP benefits only a small number of customers, while many more customers are concerned that its inclusion amounts to ideological signalling in favor of regulators. This is not and will never be the case. We staunchly oppose the rollout of regulation that infringes on privacy. It is a flawed system, and we are working to help Bitcoin evolve to a point where it is no longer relevant with privacy-focused features like CoinJoin. In the meantime, we are also looking for solutions that maximize access to bitcoin](https://blog.trezor.io/a-decision-on-aopp-789540c2930b).

The creators of AOPP disdainfully attribute this to "[fear of the cancel-culture](https://aopp.group/#faq)." Their consultant, [Leah Callon-Butler](https://twitter.com/leah_cb) of [**Emfarsis**](https://emfarsis.com/), which also lists the blockchain surveillance company **Elliptic** ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-1st---blockchain-analysis-or-financial-surveillance), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-14th---smore-schnorr-and-tapscript), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-20th---fatf-public-consultation-closes)) as a customer, [described it](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/01/crypto-twitters-misdirected-furor-didnt-fix-the-travel-rule/) as a "[storm-in-a-teacup](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+storm+in+a+teacup)." These events were discussed on [episode #4](https://youtu.be/Bm2mCjkdKR0) of Streetside Sessions and [episode #53](https://citadeldispatch.com/cd53/) of [Citadel Dispatch](https://twitter.com/ODELL/status/1488676486269661188).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

#### Anti-Money Laundering Ineffective

On November 2nd 2021, Stephan Livera published [an interview](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/318/) with [Dr Ronald F. Pol](https://www.effectiveaml.org/ron/) ([@ronaldpol](https://twitter.com/ronaldpol)), an anti-money laundering (AML) researcher and former lawyer. They discussed his paper, "[Anti-Money Laundering: The World's Least Effective Policy Experiment? Together, We Can Fix It](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339486326_Anti-money_laundering_The_world's_least_effective_policy_experiment_Together_we_can_fix_it)," from February 2020 ([TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework)). He argues that "the modern anti-money laundering experiment unwittingly enables, protects and supports terrorists, drug, human, arms and wildlife traffickers, sex and labor exploiters, and corrupt officials, fraudsters and tax evaders on a global scale."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> There is an underlying assumption that KYC is good, that we need identification, we need all sorts of identification... And certainly there are privacy people who are putting up a good argument in a number of areas, but what’s often missing from that is — it’s a belief that KYC is good. Let’s test that assumption. Do we need all of this KYC, or could we do some of it that actually has an impact?

#### Taproot Activated

I have covered the development of the Taproot/Schnorr soft fork in nearly every issue of this newsletter ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund), [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-24th---schnorr--taproot-activation), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-12th---schnorr-signaturecheckers), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-1st---smore-schnorr), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-14th---smore-schnorr-and-tapscript), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-27th---taproots-impact-on-bitcoin-privacy), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-2nd---taproot-ring-signatures), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-14th---bitcoin-core-v021-released), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-2nd---taproot-activation-meetings), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-2nd---recurring-taproot-meetings), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-15th---taproot-activation-specification-merged), [TMBIP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-25th---taproot-signalling-reaches-threshold), [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-12th---taproot-locked-in), [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-10th---taproot-adoption), [TMIBP15](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2021/#august-30th---node-support-for-taproot-in-majority)). On November 14th 2021, it was [activated](https://taproot.watch/) on schedule at block [709,632](https://blockstream.info/block/0000000000000000000687bca986194dc2c1f949318629b44bb54ec0a94d8244). [**Samourai Wallet**](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1475849387754635268) added 'send to taproot address' functionality with [v0.99.98](https://docs.samourai.io/en/wallet/releases#v09998) in December 2021, as did [JoinMarket](https://twitter.com/joinmarket/status/1494700964611244043) with [v0.9.5](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/releases/tag/v0.9.5) recently; [Sparrow Wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) already supported it as of July 2021 ([TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-10th---taproot-adoption)); [**Casa**](https://twitter.com/CasaHODL/status/1484222392142548992) ([TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-25th---taproot-signalling-reaches-threshold)) and [Nunchuck](https://twitter.com/nunchuk_io/status/1486545139468156929) are working on it for multi-sig setups, with [the goal](https://twitter.com/hugohanoi/status/1460681217003515904) of testing Taproot's threshold signatures. [**Chainalysis**](https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1460253811352776708), predictably, did not highlight 'privacy' as a [potential benefit](https://archive.fo/Kq7zz).

#### Lightning Network Privacy

In the area of Lightning Network privacy, [**ACINQ**](https://acinq.co/) software developer [Bastien Teinturier](https://twitter.com/realtbast) was interviewed in [SLP319](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/319/) about its shortcomings and opportunities for improvement, such as Taproot/Schnorr, MuSig ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-11th---design-sketch-for-first-version-of-coinswap), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-1st---smore-schnorr), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-14th---smore-schnorr-and-tapscript), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-4th---musig2), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-15th---taproot-activation-specification-merged), and [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-12th---taproot-locked-in)), [route blinding](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/765), payment decorrelation, and Trampoline routing ([TMBIP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-30th---electrum-supports-trampoline-routing)). Teinturier also spoke on these topics, [independently](https://youtu.be/gOiKlx9a1xg) and [on a panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UYdyzCyO0c), for the [**Adopting Bitcoin** (AB21) conference](https://adoptingbitcoin.org/speaker/BastienTeinturier/) in El Salvador. Starting in November, **Wasabi** offered a grant -- eventually increased in [collaboration](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1496485007254167554) with the [MAGIC](https://twitter.com/MagicGrants/status/1495774118939086851) [non-profit](https://magicgrants.org/Lightning-Network-Privacy-Grants/) and [developer](https://github.com/dangershony) [Dan Gershony](https://twitter.com/dangershony) -- for "[researchers and teams of researchers to design, (not implement), the best possible privacy-focused Lightning Network light client](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/1-11-btc-ln-privacy-grant/)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On December 10th, [**Chainalysis**](https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1469317238893289475) announced that they were "[the first blockchain analysis company to offer customers a transaction monitoring solution for the Lightning Network](https://archive.fo/3oeSD)," a capability that has been requested by the IRS ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#june-30th---irs-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins-lightning) and [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-4th---irs-still-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins)). The news was discussed at length in the [Lightning Junkies](https://twitter.com/LNJunkies/status/1470542207329263616) [podcast](https://lightningjunkies.net/chainalysis-on-lightning-network-lightningfriday-12-17-2021-with-jestopher-and-chaz/) on December 17th. You can explore Chainalysis' public government contracts [here](https://techinquiry.org/explorer/vendor/chainalysis%20inc./).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On January 31st 2022, relating to the AOPP controversy, it was suggested that [BOLT11 invoice descriptions/ memos](https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/lightning-overview/understanding-lightning-invoices) be similarly [re-evaluated from a privacy perspective](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-January/003452.html), especially given use cases like [BottlePay](https://web.archive.org/web/20210616100214/https://help.bottlepay.com/en/articles/5303125-why-and-how-do-i-verify-my-node) which require users to include personally identifying information for verification. Developer [Martin Habovštiak](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-January/003453.html) replied that the "biggest real problem" is "the fact that invoices leak txids of private channels even though they shouldn't have to," and suggested that [node IDs should be rotated to avoid reuse](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-February/003455.html).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

#### Diary Of A Non-KYC Bitcoiner

On December 31st 2021, a [pseudonymous individual](https://twitter.com/nokycbtc) declared that their New Year's resolution was to "[buy Bitcoin through non-KYC methods for the duration of 2022](https://nokycbtc.com/diary-of-a-non-kyc-bitcoiner/)," and so began their "[Diary of a Non-KYC Bitcoiner](https://nokycbtc.com/)." As of this writing, they have published three entries. If you live in a country where it is coming [more difficult](https://www.21analytics.ch/blog/swiss-regulator-further-reduces-threshold-for-buying-bitcoin-kyc-less/) to buy KYC-less, their experience may be helpful.

## February 10th - WABISABI AUDIT REPORT

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-11th---wabisabi-and-coinpool), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-19th---oxt-research-vulnerability-disclosure), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-5th---wasabi-wallet-20), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-6th---join-the-wasabikas), [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-7th---wasabi-wallet-20-update-continued), and [TMIBP16](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2021/#august-31st---wasabi-wallet-20-update-continued), I have followed development of [WabiSabi](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi), a variable-amount CoinJoin protocol that will be introduced in the next [major](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1488467163996307456) [iteration](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1489894163797757960) of **Wasabi**. On October 22nd 2021, the [Cryptoeconomic Systems (CES) Journal](https://twitter.com/CryptoEconSys/status/1455290496780156928), housed by MIT's [Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu/) (DCI) published their [second issue](https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/vol1-2) with ten review summaries of various papers, including the [WabiSabi](https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/pub/ficsor-wabisabi-coordinated-review/release/1?readingCollection=a1e776d2) paper. Criticisms noted that the paper "requires considerable pre-knowledge on the topic," therefore limiting the "audience," and there was "no rigorous evaluation or security proof."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On February 10th, [**Wasabi**](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1491774856471486464) announced that a new [Swiss-based security auditor](https://inference.ag/blog/2021-10-04-hello/) [Inference AG](https://inference.ag/company) had assessed their WabiSabi cryptographic codebase in January for "security defects (incorrect implementation, software bugs, randomness issues, data leaks, etc.)." The published [report](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/discussions/7262) includes six recommendations.

## February 15th - INTRODUCING RONINUI 2.0

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-7th---running-ronindojo), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-2nd---full-node-deep-dive-ronindojo), and [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-8th---malicious-tor-exit-relays-continued), I have followed the release and optimisation of [RoninDojo](https://twitter.com/RoninDojoNode/status/1493634529814368267), an installation assistant and interface for **Samourai Wallet**’s self-hosted full node backend which can automatically sync with their privacy-focused mobile wallet. This month, they released [v2.0.0](https://code.samourai.io/ronindojo/ronin-ui/-/releases/v2.0.0) of the [RoninUI](https://ronindojo.io/en/roninui.html). "[This release marks the beginning of a huge overhaul of our project, the end of dependence on the command line, and so much more up our sleeves!](https://twitter.com/RoninDojoNode/status/1493634590220726279)" In [a blog post](https://ronindojo.io/en/blog-introducing-ronin-ui2.html) displaying their [newly re-designed cyberpunk aesthetic](https://twitter.com/RoninDojoNode/status/1494000912385331203) and outlining their progress, they wrote about what else is coming on the roadmap:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> While these are all nice, it's just a beginning and we will continue to add more features in the near future. To name a few: calculate and display a Boltzmann score for any transaction similiar to [KYCP.org](https://kycp.org/#/), install and uninstall certain apps like local [Mempool.space](https://mempool.space/), manage your Whirlpool CLI using Ronin UI or upgrade your RoninDojo and system dependencies via Ronin UI. 

## February 16th - LIGHTPIR

[**Chaincode Labs**](https://chaincode.com/team) researcher [Sergei Tikhomirov](https://twitter.com/serg_tikhomirov/status/1494032594723299329) has [summarised and reviewed](https://s-tikhomirov.github.io/lightpir/) a paper published in April 2021 titled "[LightPIR: Privacy-Preserving Route Discovery for Payment Channel Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04293)." PIR stands for 'private information retrieval.'
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Lightning is currently source-routed. This means that each sender does a local route search on the full network graph. This may become unsustainable as Lightning grows grows. Naively outsourcing route discovery to dedicated servers harms privacy: the servers know who is paying whom.. The authors combine private information retrieval with all-pairs-shortest-path pre-computation with hub labeling, optimized for real LN topology.
> 
> ... This approach is valuable and underappreciated. Most likely, there are lots of valuable ideas in scientific literature from long before Bitcoin came along, waiting to be applied in modern development. However, at least in the case of LightPIR, more effort is required to turn this protocol into an implementation-ready proposal.

## February 17th - JUSTICE DEPARTMENT APPOINTS NCET DIRECTOR

In October 2021, the [U.S. Department of Justice](https://twitter.com/TheJusticeDept/status/1445858616955871232) ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-7th---chainalysis-and-the-boiling-frog), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-8th---sim-swapping-conspiracy-charges), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-1st---irs-john-doe-summons-to-exchanges), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-5th---irs-john-doe-summons-to-exchanges-continued)) [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-announces-national-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team) the creation of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) "to tackle complex investigations and prosecutions of criminal misuses of cryptocurrency, particularly crimes committed by virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and money laundering infrastructure actors."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Under the supervision of Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr., the NCET will combine the expertise of the Department of Justice Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and other sections in the division, with experts detailed from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices. The team will also assist in tracing and recovery of assets lost to fraud and extortion, including cryptocurrency payments to ransomware groups.

This month, following the "application process seeking an individual with experience with complex criminal investigations and prosecutions, as well as the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies and the blockchain," [they](https://twitter.com/TheJusticeDept/status/1494345235874426886) have selected [Eun Young Choi](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-first-director-national-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team) as the first director of NCET. Choi is described as "an accomplished leader on cyber and cryptocurrency issues." The summary of her career includes acting as "lead prosecutor" in the [Coin.mx](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-chairman-and-ceo-federal-credit-union-and-computer-programmer-unlawful-bitcoin) and [Panama Papers tax evasion](https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/us-taxpayer-in-panama-papers-investigation-sentenced-to-four-years-in-prison) cases, and on behalf of the U.S. government "successfully argu[ing] the appeal before the Second Circuit in the case against Ross Ulbricht." That [appeal](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17A559/20426/20171116135157920_Ulbricht%20Application%20Appendix%20paginated.pdf), where Choi is listed as the assistant attorney for [Preet](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ross-ulbricht-creator-and-owner-silk-road-website-found-guilty-manhattan-federal-court) [Bharara](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ross-ulbricht-aka-dread-pirate-roberts-sentenced-manhattan-federal-court-life-prison), concerned whether Judge Katherine B. Forrest had "erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment," "committed several errors that deprived him of his right to a fair trial, and incorrectly denied his motion for a new trial," and if "his life sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Exactly two months earlier on December 17th 2021, Ulbricht reached his "[3,000th day in prison](https://twitter.com/RealRossU/status/1471896472010514437)." Just two days earlier on February 15th, Ulbricht's managed account had tweeted: "[There’s no such thing as a life sentence. It’s just a death sentence that takes a while](https://twitter.com/RealRossU/status/1493667551590633484)."

## February 22nd - SPARROW WALLET SUPPORTS PAYNYMS

In [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-20th---dirtcoin-diaries-paynym-torch), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-30th---introducing-soroban), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-15th---new-bip47-draft-and-paynym-torch), and [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-15th---signal-accepts-bitcoin-donations), I have covered adoption of the [BIP-47](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) specification. In [TMIBP16](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2021/#september-23rd---samourai-like-type-change-outputs), Sparrow Wallet released a compatible implementation of [Whirlpool](https://www.samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool) to do CoinJoin. On February 22nd, lead developer Craig Raw also committed support for "[linking, sending to and receiving from](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/commit/e83c02653c0b81c649b56203ea7a0de202249769)" BIP-47 PayNyms, which will likely come with the next code release. On the same day, [**BTC Sessions**](https://twitter.com/BTCsessions/status/1496161836772773894) host Ben Perrin published [a tutorial](https://youtu.be/w6o_3sUcHHY) for this feature in [**Samourai Wallet**](https://samouraiwallet.com/paynym), the only wallet to have implemented it so far.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Last year in July 2021, [Habovštiak](https://twitter.com/kixunil) published a [draft proposal](https://gist.github.com/Kixunil/0ddb3a9cdec33342b97431e438252c0a) for reusable Taproot addresses, based on the BIP-47 scheme but also trying to improve on some of its issues. So far it has notably received interest and suggestions from [Laurent](https://twitter.com/LaurentMT), [Ruben Somsen](https://twitter.com/SomsenRuben), and **JoinMarket** contributor [Adam Gibson](https://github.com/AdamISZ).

In December 2021, [Janey Gak](https://twitter.com/janeygak/status/1494143783373529090) wrote about [why PayNyms were useful for helping her fellow Afghans receive bitcoin](https://medium.com/@janeygak/using-bitcoin-to-receive-anonymous-donations-bypass-sanctions-and-help-afghans-323c7c679fbc); her [translation](https://twitter.com/janeygak/status/929896682082279425), [educational](https://twitter.com/janeygak/status/1434108724990431240), and [fundraising](https://twitter.com/janeygak/status/1452656882422792195) [efforts](https://twitter.com/janeygak/status/1472935888183341056) had previously been featured by [**CNBC**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/21/bitcoin-afghanistan-cryptocurrency-taliban-capital-flight.html) in August.

> The reality is that many good hearted people do not want to take the risk of sending donations to a sanctioned country like Afghanistan. So for those who want to donate privately, PayNyms offers an easy solution.

Make no mistake, the need is not limited to those in countries under sanction. If your government has recently been [expanding the definitions of terrorism](https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-february-07-2022) to include "malinformation"

## February 28th - COINSWAP ALPHA RELEASE

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-11th---design-sketch-for-first-version-of-coinswap), and [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-8th---coinswap-on-testnet), I covered the early development of a working [CoinSwap](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinSwap) protocol. At the end of the month, [Chris Belcher](https://twitter.com/chris_belcher_/status/1498306087300259848) announced that he has [released an alpha version](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-February/020026.html) of the project as "[Teleport Transactions](https://github.com/bitcoin-teleport/teleport-transactions/)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The project is almost completely decentralized and available for all to use for free (baring things like miner fees). So far it is only really usable by developers and power-users to play around with. It doesnt have all the necessary features yet, but from now on I'll be doing new releases very often as soon as every new feature gets added. It is possible to run it on mainnet, but only the brave will attempt that, and only with small amounts. I've personally made many coinswaps on the testnet and signet networks, and I'll be running market makers on signet which will be available for anyone to create coinswaps with.
>
> Right now it just uses 2of2 multisig for the coinswap addresses. Those address types are rare on the blockchain so the coinswaps stand out a fair amount (although protocols like lightning also use 2of2 multisig). However the next really big task on my todo list is to use ECDSA-2p which would make these multisig addresses look like regular single-sig addresses, which are overwhelmingly common out there and so provide an enormous anonymity set.
>
> My aim is that the Teleport project will develop into a practical and secure project on the bitcoin mainnet, usable either standalone as a kind of bitcoin mixing app, or as a library that existing wallets will implement allowing their users with the touch of a button to send bitcoin coinswap transactions with much greater privacy than as possible before.

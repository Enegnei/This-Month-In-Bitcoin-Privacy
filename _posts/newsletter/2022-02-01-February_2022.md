### Crypteconomic Systems Journal Review Summaries

On October 22nd 2021, the [Cryptoeconomic Systems (CES) Journal](https://twitter.com/CryptoEconSys/status/1455290496780156928), housed by MIT's [Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu/) (DCI) published their [second issue](https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/vol1-2) with ten review summaries of various papers, including the [WabiSabi](https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/pub/ficsor-wabisabi-coordinated-review/release/1?readingCollection=a1e776d2) paper ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-11th---wabisabi-and-coinpool), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-19th---oxt-research-vulnerability-disclosure), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-5th---wasabi-wallet-20), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-6th---join-the-wasabikas), [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-7th---wasabi-wallet-20-update-continued), [TMIBP16](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2021/#august-31st---wasabi-wallet-20-update-continued)).

### Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP)

As I covered in the last [TMIBP17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-1st---fatf-travel-rule-updates), the **Financial Action Task Force** (FATF) finalised and published their [updated guidance for virtual asset service providers](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html) (VASPs) at the end of October. Back in November 2020 ([TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-16th---know-your-customers-customer-kycc)), I also covered the emergence of KYCC polices in the Netherlands and Switzerland that required customers of such obliged entities to somehow confirm the ownership of addresses where coins were being withdrawn to. Meanwhile, the Swiss-based "[compliance and data protection](https://www.21analytics.ch/about/)" company **21 Analytics** has written about the various ways to perform "[non-custodial address ownership proof](https://www.21analytics.ch/blog/the-hassle-of-travel-rule-transacting-with-non-custodial-wallets/)," given inconsistent compliance between countries. On January 18th 2022, they published [a similar blog post](https://www.21analytics.ch/blog/unhosted-wallet-verification-methods-an-overview/), but with heavier emphasis on and promotion of their new [Address Ownership Proof Protocol](https://aopp.group/) (AOPP) for [Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://gitlab.com/aopp/address-ownership-proof-protocol/-/blob/master/README.md) addresses, which they claimed was "already supported by BitBox, BlueWallet, Sparrow, and others. Work is underway to add AOPP support to Trezor and Ledger."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Two weeks earlier, **Trezor** had explained how to use their 'Sign & Verify' feature to "[send [a] message, address and signature to whomever requested proof of ownership](https://blog.trezor.io/how-to-prove-ownership-of-your-keys-and-keep-them-safe-f566ec5664c8)," though this was not identified as AOPP or even marketed as a compliance tool. Indeed, in and of itself, the ability to create and verify digitally signed messages is a basic function of [public key cryptography](https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html#pkc) systems, and could be used for integrity checks in a pure peer-to-peer context. However, on January 19th, they confirmed that the AOPP-specific proof format had been integrated into the Suite interface, "[saving time when dealing with some jurisdictions’ regulations](https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-suite-and-trezor-model-one-firmware-updates-january-2022-4a77e4a07a5a)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Following this [explicit association](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/27/trezor-adopts-swiss-travel-rule-protocol-for-private-crypto-wallets/) with [Travel Rule compliance](https://www.21analytics.ch/21-travel-rule-solution/), **Samourai Wallet** and others argued that "[by buying into this system you are legitimizing the concept that self custody requires permission & compliance](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1486771414761971715)." **Trezor** [initially](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1486747863912796171) [defended](https://twitter.com/slush/status/1486738933824241665) the decision, pointing out that "the message for signing is composed of information already available to the exchange." On January 28th, [they](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1487091879883722755) and a [few](https://twitter.com/bluewalletio/status/1486805550608392194) [other](https://twitter.com/SparrowWallet/status/1486785866739728386) wallets reversed the changes:

> [As a proudly independent company, our decisions are always made in support of individuals. In this case, AOPP benefits only a small number of customers, while many more customers are concerned that its inclusion amounts to ideological signalling in favor of regulators. This is not and will never be the case. We staunchly oppose the rollout of regulation that infringes on privacy. It is a flawed system, and we are working to help Bitcoin evolve to a point where it is no longer relevant with privacy-focused features like CoinJoin. In the meantime, we are also looking for solutions that maximize access to bitcoin](https://blog.trezor.io/a-decision-on-aopp-789540c2930b).

The creators of AOPP disdainfully attribute this to "[fear of the cancel-culture](https://aopp.group/#faq)." Their consultant, [Leah Callon-Butler](https://twitter.com/leah_cb) of [**Emfarsis**](https://emfarsis.com/), [described it](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/01/crypto-twitters-misdirected-furor-didnt-fix-the-travel-rule/) as a "[storm-in-a-teacup](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+storm+in+a+teacup)."

### Anti-Money Laundering Ineffective

On November 2nd 2021, Stephan Livera published [an interview](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/318/) with [Dr Ronald F. Pol](https://www.effectiveaml.org/ron/) ([@ronaldpol](https://twitter.com/ronaldpol)), an anti-money laundering (AML) researcher and former lawyer. They discussed his paper, "[Anti-Money Laundering: The World's Least Effective Policy Experiment? Together, We Can Fix It](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339486326_Anti-money_laundering_The_world's_least_effective_policy_experiment_Together_we_can_fix_it)," from February 2020 ([TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework)). He argues that "the modern anti-money laundering experiment unwittingly enables, protects and supports terrorists, drug, human, arms and wildlife traffickers, sex and labor exploiters, and corrupt officials, fraudsters and tax evaders on a global scale."

> There is an underlying assumption that KYC is good, that we need identification, we need all sorts of identification... And certainly there are privacy people who are putting up a good argument in a number of areas, but what’s often missing from that is — it’s a belief that KYC is good. Let’s test that assumption. Do we need all of this KYC, or could we do some of it that actually has an impact?

### Lightning Network Privacy

In the area of Lightning Network privacy, [**ACINQ**](https://acinq.co/) software developer [Bastien Teinturier](https://twitter.com/realtbast) was interviewed in [SLP319](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/319/) about its shortcomings and opportunities for improvement, such as Taproot/Schnorr, MuSig ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-11th---design-sketch-for-first-version-of-coinswap), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-1st---smore-schnorr), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-14th---smore-schnorr-and-tapscript), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-4th---musig2), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-15th---taproot-activation-specification-merged), and [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-12th---taproot-locked-in)), [route blinding](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/765), payment decorrelation, and Trampoline routing ([TMBIP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-30th---electrum-supports-trampoline-routing)). Teinturier also spoke on these topics, [independently](https://youtu.be/gOiKlx9a1xg) and [on a panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UYdyzCyO0c), for the [**Adopting Bitcoin** (AB21) conference](https://adoptingbitcoin.org/speaker/BastienTeinturier/) in El Salvador. Starting in November, **Wasabi** offered a grant -- eventually increased in [collaboration](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1496485007254167554) with the [MAGIC](https://twitter.com/MagicGrants/status/1495774118939086851) [non-profit](https://magicgrants.org/Lightning-Network-Privacy-Grants/) and [developer](https://github.com/dangershony) [Dan Gershony](https://twitter.com/dangershony) -- for "[researchers and teams of researchers to design, (not implement), the best possible privacy-focused Lightning Network light client](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/1-11-btc-ln-privacy-grant/)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On December 10th, [**Chainalysis**](https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1469317238893289475) announced that they were "[the first blockchain analysis company to offer customers a transaction monitoring solution for the Lightning Network](https://archive.fo/3oeSD)," a capability that has been requested by the IRS ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#june-30th---irs-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins-lightning) and [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-4th---irs-still-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins)). The news was discussed at length in the [Lightning Junkies](https://twitter.com/LNJunkies/status/1470542207329263616) [podcast](https://lightningjunkies.net/chainalysis-on-lightning-network-lightningfriday-12-17-2021-with-jestopher-and-chaz/) on December 17th.

### Diary Of A Non-KYC Bitcoiner

On December 31st 2021, a [pseudonymous individual](https://twitter.com/nokycbtc) declared that their New Year's resolution was to "[buy Bitcoin through non-KYC methods for the duration of 2022](https://nokycbtc.com/diary-of-a-non-kyc-bitcoiner/)," and so began their "[Diary of a Non-KYC Bitcoiner](https://nokycbtc.com/)." As of this writing, they have published three entries. If you live in a country where it is coming [more difficult](https://www.21analytics.ch/blog/swiss-regulator-further-reduces-threshold-for-buying-bitcoin-kyc-less/) to buy KYC-less, their experience may be helpful.

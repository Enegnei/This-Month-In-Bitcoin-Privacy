## June 3rd - REMOVING TOR V2 SUPPORT

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-11th---bip155-and-tor-onions-v3), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-23rd---release-candidate-testing), and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-10th---tor-consensus-issue), I have been following Tor’s v3 onion service upgrade and its effect on Bitcoin. On June 3rd, Wladimir van der Laan [merged](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22050#event-4838712564) the pull-request from [Jon Atack](https://jonatack.github.io/) (who later received a $100,000 grant from [**Strike**](https://twitter.com/ln_strike/status/1409938668890968066)), removing support for v2, ahead of the [**Tor Project**](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline)'s scheduled deprecation next month. The latest Tor browser release announcement warns to "[migrate your services and update your bookmarks to version 3 onion services as soon as possible](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-10018)." After the merge, Pieter Wuille tweeted out that "[for the next major release we're dropping V2 support](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1400501077263278081)," and the [**Tor Project**](https://twitter.com/torproject/status/1400513923074314241) amplified this.

## June 25th - FATF DELAYS FINALISING GUIDANCE

In [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-19th---fatf-public-consultation-on-virtual-assets) and [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-20th---fatf-public-consultation-closes), I covered the **Financial Action Task Force** (FATF)'s open consultation regarding their guidance on "[the risk-based approach to virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs)](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html)." The public consultation closed in April, and this month "[delegates representing the 205 members of the Global Network and observer organisations, such as the IMF, the United Nations and the World Bank met virtually](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfgeneral/documents/outcomes-fatf-plenary-june-2021.html)" for the FATF's fourth plenary.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The Plenary finalised a second 12-month review of the implementation of FATF’s revised Standards on virtual assets and VASPs. The report finds that many jurisdictions have continued to make progress in implementing these revisions, finalised in 2019. So far, 58 out of 128 reporting jurisdictions advised that they have now implemented the revised FATF Standards, with 52 of these regulating VASPs and six of these prohibiting the operation of VASPs. The private sector have made progress in developing technological solutions to enable the implementation of the ‘travel rule’. However, the majority of jurisdictions have not yet implemented the FATFs requirements, including the “travel rule”. This disincentivises further investment in the necessary technology solutions and compliance infrastructure. These gaps in implementation also mean that we do not yet have global safeguards to prevent the misuse of VASPs for money laundering or terrorist financing. The lack of regulation or implementation of regulation in jurisdictions can enable continued misuse of virtual assets through jurisdictional arbitrage.

They state that "the report will be published on 5 July" and the guidance would be finalised "in October 2021."

The day prior, [**Coin Desk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1408165002968719363) reporter [Ian Allison](https://twitter.com/IanAllison123) had noted that according to 'regulatory insiders,' there was "[such an enthusiastic response from the industry that some are predicting the FATF will likely kick the can down the road to its next plenary meeting in four months’ time](https://www.coindesk.com/what-crypto-firms-can-expect-from-fridays-fatf-plenary-meeting)," particularly as a result of their attempt to try "to catch everything in DeFi" and (according to the plenary summary) only "[58 out of 128 reporting jurisdictions](https://www.coindesk.com/fatf-says-most-countries-still-havent-implemented-aml-watchdogs-crypto-guidance)" implementing their revised standards.

Meanwhile, [Allison](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1408440389946724353) also reported that members of the U.S Travel Rule Working Group (USTRWG), specifically engineers from "**BitGo**, **Coinbase**, **Gemini**, **Kraken**, and **Fidelity**," had completed a demonstration of version 1.0 of their Travel Rule solution, using "[dummy PII, just to test that the plumbing works](https://www.coindesk.com/us-crypto-giants-build-first-version-of-fatf-compliant-travel-rule-tool)." They intend to "begin sending transactions accompanied by real customer PII by the end of Q4." I have followed FATF's 'travel rule' and related policy developments in [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-20th---how-i-knew-your-customer-fatf-compliance), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-16th---know-your-customers-customer-kycc), and [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all).

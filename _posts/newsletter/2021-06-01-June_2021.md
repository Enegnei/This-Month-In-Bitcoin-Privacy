## June 3rd - REMOVING TOR V2 SUPPORT

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-11th---bip155-and-tor-onions-v3), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-23rd---release-candidate-testing), and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-10th---tor-consensus-issue), I have been following Tor’s v3 onion service upgrade and its effect on Bitcoin. On June 3rd, Wladimir van der Laan [merged](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22050#event-4838712564) the pull-request from [Jon Atack](https://jonatack.github.io/) (who later received a $100,000 grant from [**Strike**](https://twitter.com/ln_strike/status/1409938668890968066)), removing support for v2, ahead of the [**Tor Project**](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline)'s scheduled deprecation next month. The latest Tor browser release announcement warns to "[migrate your services and update your bookmarks to version 3 onion services as soon as possible](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-10018)." After the merge, Pieter Wuille tweeted out that "[for the next major release we're dropping V2 support](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1400501077263278081)," and the [**Tor Project**](https://twitter.com/torproject/status/1400513923074314241) amplified this.

> This patch removes support in Bitcoin Core for Tor v2 onions, which are already removed from the release of Tor 0.4.6.
> + no longer serialize/deserialize and relay Tor v2 addresses
> + ignore incoming Tor v2 addresses
> + remove Tor v2 addresses from the addrman and peers.dat on node launch
> + update generate-seeds.py to ignore Tor v2 addresses
> + remove Tor v2 hard-coded seeds

On June 28th, [**Bisq**](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1409868701327781888) finished [v1.7.0](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.7.0) which included a merged [pull-request](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5573) to prompt users to [upgrade to Tor v3 addresses](https://bisq.wiki/Changing_your_onion_address) and announced that they would set this release as the "required minimum version for trading" in one week. It also fixed "a privacy issue" that would be disclosed.

## June 10th - IMPROVING OFF-CHAIN PROTOCOL PRIVACY

JoinMarket, Electrum Personal Server, and CoinSwap developer [Chris Belcher](https://twitter.com/chris_belcher_) published the draft of a new [Bitcoin Improvement Proposal](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals) (BIP) to the mailing list: "[Anti-fee-sniping protection with nSequence in taproot
transactions to improve privacy for off-chain protocols](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-June/019048.html)." He writes that it "proposes a certain type of wallet behaviour" with Taproot that will provide "a greater anonymity set for off-chain protocols which will make use of point-time-locked contracts (PTLCs) such as CoinSwap, Lightning and Discrete Log Contracts." I have covered development and analysis of these protocols from a privacy perspective previously in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-11th---design-sketch-for-first-version-of-coinswap), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-27th---taproots-impact-on-bitcoin-privacy), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-8th---coinswap-on-testnet), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-2nd---taproot-activation-meetings), and others.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> This BIP proposes to improve the privacy and fungibility of off-chain protocols by having on-chain wallets like Bitcoin Core also set the nSequence field in their taproot transactions as in BIP68. This would be in place of their regular nLockTime anti-fee-sniping protection. The end result is that, if an observer of the blockchain sees a taproot spend with an nSequence value, then that could be either: a regular spend from a wallet, or an off-chain settlement transaction spent with a timelock.

## June 12th - TAPROOT LOCKED IN

Last month's [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-25th---taproot-signalling-reaches-threshold) covered Taproot reaching the [signalling threshold](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/95-miners-potentially-activating-taproot) for lock-in, which was solidified by June 12th and kept the soft fork on schedule for November activation.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [If miners would signal support for the upgrade in 90% of all blocks within a single two-week difficulty period (1,815 or more blocks out of 2,016), Taproot would activate on block 709,632, estimated to be mined this November](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/taproot-locks-in).

In celebration, [Pieter Wuille](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1403725170993336322) shared the whole timeline of Taproot development:

> It's been a long story, that started in a diner in Los Altos, CA where in Greg Maxwell, Andrew Poelstra and I somewhere in January 2018 had lunch. While I briefly had to leave the table, they had come up with a really cool idea to hide Merkle roots in P2PK-like outputs.
> 
> A few months later, a few people including me started writing a specification to focus on this idea as an upgrade to Bitcoin's script capabilities. There were so many ideas, but we couldn't realistically include everything in one proposal. At the time there were so many ideas even for "structural" Script improvements (not counting ideas for new opcodes); there was cross-input signature aggregation, graftroot, g'root, of course Taproot itself, ...
> 
> Initially my hope was to create one proposal that did all of them. But given how fast ideas were evolving, it seemed better to focus on a subset (primarily things usable without interactive setup) + bugfixes + upgrade mechanisms.
>
> In May 2019, [@ajtowns](https://twitter.com/ajtowns), [@n1ckler](https://twitter.com/n1ckler), [@real_or_random](https://twitter.com/real_or_random), and I published the first drafts of these BIPs. The following months several improvements were made in response to feedback; x-only pubkeys were introduced, the quadratic residuosity tiebreaker was removed, and the sighashing scheme was improved to include all scriptPubKeys being spent. At the end of 2019, structured review sessions were organized by [@bitcoinoptech](https://twitter.com/bitcoinoptech) and [@ajtowns](https://twitter.com/ajtowns), which brought in many eyes (though the number seemed to shrink a bit over time...) and questions, but mostly, I think it helped bring exposure to the ideas in it.
> 
> August 2020 would mark the last semantic change to the proposal, reverting the quadratic residue tiebreaker after realizing it wasn't actually helping performance, and making matters more complicated. A few months later in October the proposal was considered mature and accepted enough to be merged into the Bitcoin Core codebase - without activation - ready to be include in the 0.21.0 release. This allowed testing on testnet without affecting mainnet.
> 
> ... Thanks to everyone who has helped us get this far - contributors to the BIPs, to the reference code, reviewers of those[.] But this is also just the beginning. The real work will be in the ecosystem of wallets and other applications adopting changes to make use of Taproot.

## June 16th - PRIVACY IN TREZOR SUITE

In [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-9th---trezor-to-add-coinjoin-and-coin-control), I included plans in the development [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/trezor/projects/28) of [**Trezor**](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1405179638800912389) to introduce coin control and CoinJoin in their product. This month they wrote about [these and other privacy features for their new Suite interface](https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-suite-privacy-made-easy-f73771fb2037), including Tor Switch for network traffic protection (highlighted in [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-8th---malicious-tor-exit-relays-continued)), [locktime](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/ab539e614a8497099458ddc6d29275fe0f74db78/ch12.asciidoc), and 'Discreet mode' that "blurs out all sensitive data, only revealing it on mouse-over."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Privacy is often a secondary focus for those building on Bitcoin. Ensuring there is robust infrastructure in place for Bitcoin is a priority; confidentiality at the expense of sound money would be a mistake. Instead, greater anonymity is achieved through separate tools that obscure interactions with the base layer.

## June 25th - FATF DELAYS FINALISING GUIDANCE

In [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-19th---fatf-public-consultation-on-virtual-assets) and [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-20th---fatf-public-consultation-closes), I covered the **Financial Action Task Force** (FATF)'s open consultation regarding their guidance on "[the risk-based approach to virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs)](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html)." The public consultation closed in April, and this month "[delegates representing the 205 members of the Global Network and observer organisations, such as the IMF, the United Nations and the World Bank met virtually](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfgeneral/documents/outcomes-fatf-plenary-june-2021.html)" for the FATF's fourth plenary.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The Plenary finalised a second 12-month review of the implementation of FATF’s revised Standards on virtual assets and VASPs. The report finds that many jurisdictions have continued to make progress in implementing these revisions, finalised in 2019. So far, 58 out of 128 reporting jurisdictions advised that they have now implemented the revised FATF Standards, with 52 of these regulating VASPs and six of these prohibiting the operation of VASPs. The private sector have made progress in developing technological solutions to enable the implementation of the ‘travel rule’. However, the majority of jurisdictions have not yet implemented the FATFs requirements, including the “travel rule”. This disincentivises further investment in the necessary technology solutions and compliance infrastructure. These gaps in implementation also mean that we do not yet have global safeguards to prevent the misuse of VASPs for money laundering or terrorist financing. The lack of regulation or implementation of regulation in jurisdictions can enable continued misuse of virtual assets through jurisdictional arbitrage.

They state that "the report will be published on 5 July" and the guidance would be finalised "in October 2021."

The day prior, [**Coin Desk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1408165002968719363) reporter [Ian Allison](https://twitter.com/IanAllison123) had noted that according to 'regulatory insiders,' there was "[such an enthusiastic response from the industry that some are predicting the FATF will likely kick the can down the road to its next plenary meeting in four months’ time](https://www.coindesk.com/what-crypto-firms-can-expect-from-fridays-fatf-plenary-meeting)," particularly as a result of their attempt to try "to catch everything in DeFi" and (according to the plenary summary) only "[58 out of 128 reporting jurisdictions](https://www.coindesk.com/fatf-says-most-countries-still-havent-implemented-aml-watchdogs-crypto-guidance)" implementing their revised standards. Lawyer Jake Chervinsky shared the news and said, "[Thanks to everyone who wrote comments. This is a good start](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1408436325519405057)!"
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Meanwhile, [Allison](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1408440389946724353) also reported that members of the U.S Travel Rule Working Group (USTRWG), specifically engineers from "**BitGo**, **Coinbase**, **Gemini**, **Kraken**, and **Fidelity**," had completed a demonstration of) version 1.0 of their Travel Rule solution, using "[dummy PII, just to test that the plumbing works](https://www.coindesk.com/us-crypto-giants-build-first-version-of-fatf-compliant-travel-rule-tool)." They intend to "begin sending transactions accompanied by real customer PII by the end of Q4." I have followed FATF's 'travel rule' and related policy developments in [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-20th---how-i-knew-your-customer-fatf-compliance), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-16th---know-your-customers-customer-kycc), and [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all).

## January 6th - SHAPESHIFT

In [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-8th---cross-chain-atomic-swaps-with-monero), I mentioned that **ShapeShift** was once one of the most popular portals for swapping between bitcoin and Monero.

## January 7th - FINCEN RULEMAKING COMMENT PERIOD ENDS

## January 10th - TOR CONSENSUS ISSUE

## January 13th - LEDGER DATA DUMP UPDATE

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-29th---ledger-data-breach) and [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-20th---ledger-data-dump), I covered [the data breach](https://www.ledger.com/addressing-the-july-2020-e-commerce-and-marketing-data-breach) of customer information from [e-commerce and marketing database(s)](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015559320-E-commerce-and-Marketing-data-breach-FAQ) used by hardware wallet company [**Ledger**](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1349375083891011591). Over one million email addresses and 272,853 shipping orders were dumped on [RaidForums](https://archive.is/RdBtk) last month. They have since been informed of [further leaks](https://www.ledger.com/blog/update-efforts-to-protect-your-data-and-prosecute-the-scammers) through **Shopify**.

> **Now, we have new information to share:** on December 23rd, 2020 we received a notification from our e-commerce service provider, Shopify, regarding an incident involving merchant data in which rogue member(s) of their support team obtained customer transactional records, including Ledgerâ€™s. The agent(s) illegally exported customer transactional records in April and June 2020. According to Shopify, this is related to the incident reported [September 2020](https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Incident-Update/td-p/888971), which concerns more than 200 merchants, but until December 21st, 2020, Shopify had not discovered that Ledger was also targeted in this attack. Shopify tells us they engaged digital forensics experts and counsel to continue their investigation on the matter and have reported the matter to law enforcement in both Canada and the USA.
>
> Along with forensic firm Orange Cyberdefense we were able to establish that it affects approximately 292,000 customers. While the database is 93% similar to those [exposed in the previous attack](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015559320-E-commerce-and-Marketing-data-breach-FAQ) there were approximately 20,000 new customer records including, email, name, postal address, product(s) ordered and phone number included in this breach.

**Ledger** is offering "a bounty fund of 10 BTC for information leading to successful arrest and prosecution."

:warning: If you were impacted by this breach, I recommend Kraken's "[Security Advisory: Mobile Phones](https://blog.kraken.com/post/219/security-advisory-mobile-phones/)," Jameson Lopp's "[A Home Defense Primer](https://blog.keys.casa/a-home-defense-primer/)," "[A Modest Privacy Protection Proposal](https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/)," and Michael Bazzell's "[Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show](https://www.stitcher.com/show/the-complete-privacy-security-podcast)."

## Month Day - HEADER TITLE

## January 6th - SHAPESHIFT

In [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-8th---cross-chain-atomic-swaps-with-monero), I mentioned that **ShapeShift** was once one of the most popular portals for swapping between bitcoin and Monero.

## January 10th - TOR CONSENSUS ISSUE

## January 13th - LEDGER DATA DUMP UPDATE

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-29th---ledger-data-breach) and [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-20th---ledger-data-dump), I covered [the data breach](https://www.ledger.com/addressing-the-july-2020-e-commerce-and-marketing-data-breach) of customer information from [e-commerce and marketing database(s)](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015559320-E-commerce-and-Marketing-data-breach-FAQ) used by hardware wallet company [**Ledger**](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1349375083891011591). Over one million email addresses and 272,853 shipping orders were dumped on [RaidForums](https://archive.is/RdBtk) last month. They have since been informed of [further leaks](https://www.ledger.com/blog/update-efforts-to-protect-your-data-and-prosecute-the-scammers) through **Shopify**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> **Now, we have new information to share:** on December 23rd, 2020 we received a notification from our e-commerce service provider, Shopify, regarding an incident involving merchant data in which rogue member(s) of their support team obtained customer transactional records, including Ledgerâ€™s. The agent(s) illegally exported customer transactional records in April and June 2020. According to Shopify, this is related to the incident reported [September 2020](https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Incident-Update/td-p/888971), which concerns more than 200 merchants, but until December 21st, 2020, Shopify had not discovered that Ledger was also targeted in this attack. Shopify tells us they engaged digital forensics experts and counsel to continue their investigation on the matter and have reported the matter to law enforcement in both Canada and the USA.
>
> Along with forensic firm Orange Cyberdefense we were able to establish that it affects approximately 292,000 customers. While the database is 93% similar to those [exposed in the previous attack](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015559320-E-commerce-and-Marketing-data-breach-FAQ) there were approximately 20,000 new customer records including, email, name, postal address, product(s) ordered and phone number included in this breach.

**Ledger** is offering "a bounty fund of 10 BTC for information leading to successful arrest and prosecution."

:warning: If you were impacted by this breach, I recommend Kraken's "[Security Advisory: Mobile Phones](https://blog.kraken.com/post/219/security-advisory-mobile-phones/)," Jameson Lopp's "[A Home Defense Primer](https://blog.keys.casa/a-home-defense-primer/)," "[A Modest Privacy Protection Proposal](https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/)," and Michael Bazzell's "[Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/200-stalking-doxing-and-online-harassment/id1165843330?i=1000504074121)."

## January 14th - BITCOIN CORE V0.21 RELEASED

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-11th---bip155-and-tor-onions-v3) and [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-23rd---release-candidate-testing), I covered privacy-related changes coming with the release of [Bitcoin Core v0.21](https://twitter.com/bitcoincoreorg/status/1349720304680054784). Lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan has since published [the final candidate](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2021-January/000097.html).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> This release adds support for Tor version 3 hidden services, and rumoring them over the network to other peers using [BIP155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki). Version 2 hidden services are still fully supported by Bitcoin Core, but the Tor network will start [deprecating](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline) them in the coming months. (#19954)
>
> The Tor onion service that is automatically created by setting the `-listenonion` configuration parameter will now be created as a Tor v3 service instead of Tor v2. The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be left untouched in the `onion_private_key` file in the data directory (see `-datadir`) and can be removed if not needed. Bitcoin Core will no longer attempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a file named `onion_v3_private_key`. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not recommended), the `onion_private_key` can be copied over `onion_v3_private_key`, e.g. `cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key`. (#19954)

In nearly every issue of this newsletter so far ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-24th---schnorr--taproot-activation), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-12th---schnorr-signaturecheckers), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-1st---smore-schnorr), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-14th---smore-schnorr-and-tapscript), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-27th---taproots-impact-on-bitcoin-privacy), and [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-2nd---taproot-ring-signatures)), I have followed discussions and review of the upcoming Schnorr / Taproot soft fork. As expected, this release "implements the proposed Taproot consensus rules ([BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki) and [BIP342](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki)), without activation on mainnet" yet.

## January 21st - FINCEN PROPOSED RULEMAKING SUSPENDED

In [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all), I covered a notice of proposed rulemaking from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) director Kenneth Blanco that would require banks and money service businesses to identify and file currency transaction reports (CTRs) on customers -- and potentially non-customers -- who transfer cryptocurrency to / from non-custodial wallets. This is part of a broader push to implement inter-VASP customer data sharing practices under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On January 4th, the [**Electronic Frontier Foundation**](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1346283097864585216) [legislative activist](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/hayley-tsukayama) [Hayley Tsukayama](https://twitter.com/htsuka) and special counsel [Marta Belcher](https://twitter.com/MartaBelcher) wrote that they had sent [comments opposing the proposal](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/01/eff-fincen-stop-pushing-more-financial-surveillance) on grounds of protecting "privacy, speech and innovation." U.S. senator [Cynthia Lummis](https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1349803923993931777) of Wyoming also sent [a letter](https://www.lummis.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Sen.-Lummis-Comment-Letter.pdf) to then Secretary Mnuchin with her concerns regarding the proposed changes. She cited the recent breach of Treasury Department systems as a reason to reconsider increasing data collection requirements:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The rule fails to adopt a more appropriate risk-based approach for digital asset transactions. To this point, the BSA has heavily focused on transaction data collection from largely law-abiding account holders, instead of focusing more appropriately on illicit activity. Moreover, significant data collection can be a target for intrusion.[<sup>13</sup>](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/13/cyber-hack-on-us-treasury-by-foreign-government-.html)

On January 7th, the supposed final day of the comment period, [**Coin Center**](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-files-second-comment-in-fincen-rulemaking-challenging-its-authority-to-make-the-surveillance-rule/) filed another comment arguing that "the Treasury Department does not have the statutory authority to promulgate this regulation." A week later FinCEN [announced](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-extends-comment-period-rule-aimed-closing-anti-money-laundering) that they would be "reopening" the comment period. Blanco noted that they had "[reviewed and considered 7,506 comments](https://web.archive.org/web/20210114150938/https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-01016.pdf)" so far. [Jerry Brito](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1351639091012640773) and [Peter van Valkenburgh](https://twitter.com/valkenburgh/status/1347223648353005568) talked about this update on episode #24 of their [**Tangents**](https://coincenter.simplecast.com/episodes/fincen-backs-down-on-midnight-rulemaking) podcast. On January 20th, a further extension was enabled by [the incoming Biden administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/regulatory-freeze-pending-review/), which issued a "regulatory freeze" to "ensure that the Presidentâ€™s appointees or designees have the opportunity to review any new or pending rules."

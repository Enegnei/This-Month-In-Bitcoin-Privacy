## November 4th - MUSIG2

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-14th---smore-schnorr-and-tapscript), I highlighted the new "[MuSig2: Simple Two-Round Schnorr Multi-Signatures](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1261.pdf)" paper. Co-authors [Jonas Nick](https://twitter.com/n1ckler/status/1324057131159617539) and [Tim Ruffing](https://twitter.com/real_or_random) published [a follow-up](https://medium.com/blockstream/musig2-simple-two-round-schnorr-multisignatures-bf9582e99295) on the key differences between MuSig / MuSig1, MuSig2, and MuSig-DN, and announced that they would be presenting their work at the [Real World Crypto (RWC)](https://rwc.iacr.org/2021/) conference in January 2021.

> With the Taproot update to Bitcoin getting closer to potential activation, there has been considerable interest in the MuSig multisignature scheme. MuSig allows a group to collectively own some bitcoin and create a single signature to authorize a payment. Due to MuSigâ€™s innovative key-aggregation feature, this signature is a regular Schnorr signature that can be processed by Bitcoin once Taproot is activated. When used to create multisig wallets, MuSig reduces transaction fees and increases privacy compared to the traditional way of using the CHECKMULTISIG opcode for `n`-of-`n` signatures, which needs `n` public keys and `n` ECDSA signatures on the blockchain.

## November 5th - WASABI WALLET 2.0

A few days after their [two-year anniversary](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-31st---happy-bitcoin-whitepaper-day), [**Wasabi**](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1324260216540696577) announced the upcoming release of next-generation "[user interface (UI), user experience (UX) and coinjoin (CJ) improvements](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-wallet-2/)" in the wallet.

Adam Gibson also published [an in-depth breakdown](https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/from-mac-to-wabisabi/) of the "technical (cryptographic) underpinnings" and privacy guarantees of WabiSabi, in comparison to JoinMarket and the current implementation of Wasabi with Chaumian CoinJoins.

## November 11th - TREZOR SUITE ADDS TOR SUPPORT

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-9th---rebroadcasting-and-network-privacy) and [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-11th---bip155-and-tor-onions-v3), I have highlighted the importance of improving network privacy; in [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-27th---what-is-an-xpub), I also summarised discussion about the privacy risks for users who share extended public keys (xPubs) with untrusted third parties. In the [latest release(s)](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/releases/tag/v20.11.1) of their [new desktop application](https://blog.trezor.io/introducing-trezor-suite-public-beta-7c5949aeef45), [**Trezor**](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1326548520975806465) has [enabled](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/commit/1f526df2afa9e43e36208e7246433ab550b8ac5b#diff-2a78bf3847462032fce99353b8797e5800c906aaf47b6675d324e305732428a4) [Onion-Location](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-8th---hyperonionization) and integrated a '[Tor Switch](https://blog.trezor.io/privacy-in-trezor-suite-introducing-the-tor-switch-ac787a1c1c65)' feature, making it a little easier for users to "quickly and effectively bring greater anonymity and peace of mind by masking your network activity."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

It is important to understand how this improves user privacy and how it doesn't. Using Tor _will not_ fix poor coin management practices, "hide" your transactions, or obscure transaction history on the blockchain. Using Tor _will_ make it harder for a network observer to link your transactions with your real IP address.

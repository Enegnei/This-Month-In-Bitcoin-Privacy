## November 4th - MUSIG2

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-14th---smore-schnorr-and-tapscript), I highlighted the new "[MuSig2: Simple Two-Round Schnorr Multi-Signatures](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1261.pdf)" paper. Co-authors [Jonas Nick](https://twitter.com/n1ckler/status/1324057131159617539) and [Tim Ruffing](https://twitter.com/real_or_random) published [a follow-up](https://medium.com/blockstream/musig2-simple-two-round-schnorr-multisignatures-bf9582e99295) on the key differences between MuSig / MuSig1, MuSig2, and MuSig-DN, and announced that they would be presenting their work at the [Real World Crypto (RWC)](https://rwc.iacr.org/2021/) conference in January 2021.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> With the Taproot update to Bitcoin getting closer to potential activation, there has been considerable interest in the MuSig multisignature scheme. MuSig allows a group to collectively own some bitcoin and create a single signature to authorize a payment. Due to MuSig’s innovative key-aggregation feature, this signature is a regular Schnorr signature that can be processed by Bitcoin once Taproot is activated. When used to create multisig wallets, MuSig reduces transaction fees and increases privacy compared to the traditional way of using the CHECKMULTISIG opcode for `n`-of-`n` signatures, which needs `n` public keys and `n` ECDSA signatures on the blockchain.

## November 5th - WASABI WALLET 2.0

A few days after their [two-year anniversary](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-31st---happy-bitcoin-whitepaper-day), [**Wasabi**](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1324260216540696577) announced the upcoming release of next-generation "[user interface (UI), user experience (UX) and coinjoin (CJ) improvements](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-wallet-2/)" in the wallet.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Adam Gibson also published [an in-depth breakdown](https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/from-mac-to-wabisabi/) of the "technical (cryptographic) underpinnings" and privacy guarantees of WabiSabi, in comparison to JoinMarket and the current implementation of Wasabi with Chaumian CoinJoins.

## November 11th - TREZOR SUITE ADDS TOR SUPPORT

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-9th---rebroadcasting-and-network-privacy) and [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-11th---bip155-and-tor-onions-v3), I have highlighted the importance of improving network privacy; in [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-27th---what-is-an-xpub), I also summarised discussion about the risks for users who share addresses or even extended public keys (xPubs) with untrusted third parties. In the [latest release(s)](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/releases/tag/v20.11.1) of their [new desktop application](https://blog.trezor.io/introducing-trezor-suite-public-beta-7c5949aeef45), [**Trezor**](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1326548520975806465) has [enabled](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/commit/1f526df2afa9e43e36208e7246433ab550b8ac5b#diff-2a78bf3847462032fce99353b8797e5800c906aaf47b6675d324e305732428a4) [Onion-Location](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-8th---hyperonionization) and integrated a '[Tor Switch](https://blog.trezor.io/privacy-in-trezor-suite-introducing-the-tor-switch-ac787a1c1c65)' feature, making it a little easier for users to "quickly and effectively bring greater anonymity and peace of mind by masking your network activity." Trezor services can also be used within the [Tor browser](https://wiki.trezor.io/Tor).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

It is important to understand how this improves user privacy and how it doesn't. Using Tor can protect against network observers attempting to link off-chain data points (such as IP address and geographic location) with on-chain data. Unless you use [your own node](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook), Trezor's services will still know your address balances. Tor _will not_ fix coin management practices that correlate addresses together, "hide" your transactions, or obscure transaction history on the blockchain.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## November 12th - HOW PRIVATE IS MY PAY APP?

Last month, [**PayPal**](https://twitter.com/PayPal/status/1318930120523087873) announced that they would allow their customers to "[to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal account](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency)" after they had been granted a [Bitlicense](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/virtual_currency_businesses/bitlicense_faqs) by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Predictably, their [terms and conditions](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cryptocurrencies-tnc) regarding cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, do not allow withdrawals to other wallets. But what else is there to be concerned about beyond blocking the path to financial sovereignty?
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Freelance writer [Sara Harrison](https://twitter.com/atsaraharrison/status/1326890765465788418) and [**The Markup**](https://twitter.com/themarkup/status/1326872778004291586) published [an overview of issues](https://themarkup.org/ask-the-markup/2020/11/12/how-private-is-my-pay-app) with various payment apps' privacy policies, including PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, and Zelle.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-2nd---eff-calls-for-coinbase-transparency) and [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-21st---coinbase-releases-transparency-report), I covered the **Electronic Frontier Foundation**'s calls for more transparency from financial technology companies.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## November 16th - KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER'S CUSTOMER (KYCC)

[**Bitonic**](https://twitter.com/Bitonic), a Netherland-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced that they had "added an additional verification measure regarding Bitcoin addresses" in response to [new screening requirements](https://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/en/2/50-238362.jsp) imposed by the [Dutch central bank](https://twitter.com/DNB_NL) (DNB) under the [Sanctions Act](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0003296/2019-01-01).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> From now on, we are required to ask additional details such as the purpose with which you intend to purchase Bitcoins and what kind of wallet you use. Furthermore, we are obligated to verify that you are the legitimate owner of the given bitcoin address by requesting you to upload a screenshot from your wallet, or by signing a message.
>
> We understand that these additional measures cause nuisance for our customers and we do not agree with the measures ourselves. Therefore we offer the opportunity to formally object to these additional measures and the registration of this data. We will soon release a custom form intended specifically for this purpose. For the time being, you are invited to send complaints to privacy@bitonic.nl.

On the same day, [the DNB](https://twitter.com/DNB_NL/status/1328390190021406721) also announced that the [deadline for crypto service providers to register](https://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/en/7/50-238437.jsp) under European anti-money laundering directives was November 21st. (Note: The English version of the news bulletin confuses the [fourth](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=celex%3A32015L0849) and [fifth](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018L0843) directives together; the Dutch version cites only the fourth.) [**Bitonic**](https://twitter.com/Bitonic/status/1328764062344294402) soon notified customers that [their registration under AMLD5 had been completed](https://bitonic.nl/en/news/216/bitonic-will-receive-registration-as-a-cryptoservice-provider), though they have "[mixed feelings about the new legislation](https://bitonic.nl/en/news/212/bitonic-is-registered-with-the-dutch-central-bank-our-vision)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> On the other hand, we are very concerned about proportionality, the criminalization of the industry and especially the privacy of our customers. We see that European legislation has been introduced in other European countries with a greater understanding of the market and technology. Of all those countries, the Netherlands appears to face the most extreme demands, and we are very disappointed by this.

Journalist [Aaron van Wirdum](https://twitter.com/AaronvanW/status/1328661707313516545) shared this news, and received a response from the DNB that they do "[not impose](https://twitter.com/DNB_NL/status/1329063673286025218)" what "specific procedure for verification" these services must use, and referenced [a list of suggested methods](https://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/en/2/50-238362.jsp), including "screen sharing or video conferencing at the time of logging in." Swiss developer [David Knezić](https://twitter.com/davidknezic/status/1328669608153403392) pointed out that guidance from their [Financial Market Supervisory Authority/ Finanzmarktaufsicht](https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2019/08/20190826-mm-kryptogwg/) (FINMA), based on [Financial Action Task Force](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/RBA-VA-VASPs.pdf) (FATF) recommendations from June 2019, is similar.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-4th---europol-cybercrime-report-on-wasabi-wallet), I highlighted that these directives did not consider non-custodial wallets to be "obliged entities." In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-20th---how-i-knew-your-customer-fatf-compliance) and [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule), I covered the development of a U.S.-based inter-VASP system for sharing customer data as part of their Travel Rule compliance under the Bank Secrecy Act, which [**Reason**](https://twitter.com/reason/status/1329062927392006144) accurately describes as "[the PATRIOT Act for money](https://reason.com/2020/11/17/feds-propose-even-more-surveillance-of-your-banking-habits/)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On November 18th, in [an expert opinion post](https://www.coincenter.org/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-unhosted-wallets/) for [**Coin Center**](https://twitter.com/coincenter/status/1329066458027012096), former Department of Justice [chief of the Asset Forfeiture & Money Laundering Section](https://web.archive.org/web/20191019085931/https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao/legacy/2013/09/16/usab6105.pdf) (AFMLS) Jaikumar Ramaswamy argued that non-custodial wallets "pose less illicit finance risk than commonly believed," and that "policymakers seeking to prohibit or restrict their development and use would be wise to heed King Canute’s warning about the futility of stopping the ocean’s tides from rising."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> They effectively establish KYCC — “know your customer’s customer/counterparty” — requirements that have traditionally been resisted by financial regulators for good reason. Unlike KYC requirements which arise from a direct customer relationship, KYCC requirements unreasonably obligate non-customers to provide personally identifying information to a VASP/MSB they do not know or do business with, and whose security and privacy practices they have not evaluated, simply because they happen to transact with one of its customers. Collecting identity information from individuals who are not customers would also prove challenging for VASPs, and likely only limit access to legitimate customers — particularly those from financially disadvantaged communities who stand to benefit most from this technology — since illicit actors would simply employ so-called money mules, or use stolen and synthetic identities to defeat the requirement, just as they do with respect to KYC requirements today. The result would be to further exclude financially marginalized populations and hinder innovation which could serve their needs, without meaningfully affecting illicit financial activity.

## November 19th - DIGITAL CURRENCY, CIVIL LIBERTIES, MERCENARIES

The **Cato Institute**'s [Center for Monetary & Financial Alternatives](https://www.cato.org/centers/center-monetary-financial-alternatives) (CMFA) virtually hosted their [38th Annual Monetary Conference](https://www.cato.org/events/38th-annual-monetary-conference) with a focus on "central bank vs. private (centralized and decentralized) digital currencies." During a panel about "Digital Currency and Civil Liberties," **Human Rights Foundation** (HRF) director [Alex Gladstein](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1328772051142774784) discussed the growing "financial dragnet" around the world, both in democracies and authoritarian dictatorships.

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-1st---blockchain-analysis-or-financial-surveillance) and [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-28th---debating-blockchain-analysis), I have highlighted his debates with executives of blockchian surveillance companies. In the same [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund) and [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-4th---hrf-grants-to-joininbox-zeus-fully-noded) issues, I've also followed the foundation's grants towards developers who are making Bitcoin "more private, decentralized, and resilient."

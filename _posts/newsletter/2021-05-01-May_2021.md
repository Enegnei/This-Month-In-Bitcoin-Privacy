## May 8th - MALICIOUS TOR EXIT RELAYS, CONTINUED

In [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-9th---malicious-tor-exit-relays) and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-10th---tor-consensus-issue), I have been following issues with the Tor network and its effect on Bitcoin. According to a new follow-up post by security researcher and Tor server operator [Nusenu](https://nusenu.medium.com/tracking-one-year-of-malicious-tor-exit-relay-activities-part-ii-85c80875c5df), the attackher introducing malicious relays had "managed more than 27% of tor’s exit relay capacity" in February. "This is the largest malicious tor exit fraction I’ve ever observed by a single actor."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Nonetheless we are in a dilemma between knowingly using malicious tor exit relays vs. excluding them via the tor client configuration at the price of having a non-default configuration. This is additionally complicated by the fact that the exact nature of the attacks are not entirely known. We know about mitmproxy, sslstrip, bitcoin address rewrites and download modification attacks but it is not possible to rule out other types of attacks.

The simplest ways to protect yourself from these threats are to force [HTTPS-only](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) connections and to stay within the Tor network, which eliminates the need for exit nodes. Browser features like [Onion-Location](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-8th---hyperonionization) can help with this by redirecting you to the onion service version of websites you visit.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On May 5th, the [**Tor Project**](https://twitter.com/torproject/status/1389976266678235137) had launched a new page for checking "[the state of our major services](https://blog.torproject.org/check-status-of-tor-services)." On May 11th, they tweeted about their attempts to "[diagnose and reject bad relays](https://twitter.com/torproject/status/1392213543605309440)," and published [a list of rejected fingerprints](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/network-health/team/-/wikis/Rejected-fingerprints-found-in-attacks).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On May 13th, senior software engineer [Konstantin Darutkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darutkin) published [a report](https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/external-protocol-flooding/) about a "scheme flooding vulnerability" that affected all major browsers including Tor, though it "takes the longest to successfully run" there. "A website exploiting the scheme flooding vulnerability could create a stable and unique identifier that can link those browsing identities together." On May 14th, [**Trezor**](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1393180786120175617) highlighted their Tor Switch feature, which they had introduced into their Suite as of [November 2020](https://blog.trezor.io/privacy-in-trezor-suite-introducing-the-tor-switch-ac787a1c1c65), and said that "we're planning to allow the user to enable Tor right on the login!"

## May 13th - FINANCIAL FREEDOM AND PRIVACY

In [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-19th---civil-liberties-versus-digital-mercenaries), I featured the **Cato Institute**’s [38th Annual Monetary Conference](https://www.cato.org/events/38th-annual-monetary-conference) with a focus on “central bank vs. private (centralized and decentralized) digital currencies.” On May 13th, the center [announced](https://twitter.com/CatoCMFA/status/1392816867039928322) that their new "[Digital Currencies: Risk or Promise?](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/spring/summer-2021)" journal was online, including **Human Rights Foundation** (HRF) director [Alex Gladstein](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1392857330493001737)'s article, "[Financial Freedom and Privacy in the Post-Cash World](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/spring/summer-2021/financial-freedom-privacy-post-cash-world)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In “Cypherpunk’s Manifesto,” privacy activist Eric Hughes (1993) wrote: “We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.” The world seems destined to track toward the extinction of banknotes and an endgame of trackable and seizable CBDC and commercial money. In the post-cash world, there simply may not be very much financial freedom and privacy. In this context, bitcoin is worthy of continued study and exploration by monetary economists and human rights activists alike.

The paper covers CBDCs ([TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-27th---chimeras-of-central-bank-digital-currency)), Taproot ([TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-14th---bitcoin-core-v021-released), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-2nd---taproot-activation-meetings), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-2nd---recurring-taproot-meetings), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-15th---taproot-activation-specification-merged)), the third-party doctrine ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-15th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-2nd---eff-calls-for-coinbase-transparency), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-2nd---tax-authorities-demand-disclosures), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-17th---how-private-is-my-pay-app), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-9th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs-update), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-1st---irs-john-doe-summons-to-exchanges)), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and their 'Travel Rule' ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-20th---how-i-knew-your-customer-fatf-compliance), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-14th---fatf-report-on-red-flag-indicators), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-16th---know-your-customers-customer-kycc), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-19th---fatf-public-consultation-on-virtual-assets), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-20th---fatf-public-consultation-closes)), FinCEN and the Federal Reserve's proposed rule from October 2020 ([TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule)), and other topics within "the future of financial freedom and privacy."

## May [day] - TAPROOT SOFT FORK SIGNALLING REACHES THRESHOLD

Last month's [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-15th---taproot-activation-specification-merged) covered the merging of Taproot “speedy trial” activation parameters into the first release candidate of [Bitcoin Core 0.21.1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2021-April/000098.html). On [May 2nd](https://twitter.com/bitcoincoreorg/status/1388755385381801990), the [final release candidate](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2021-May/000099.html) with these mainnet and testnet activation parameters was published. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> If activated, these improvements will allow users of single-signature scripts, multisignature scripts, and complex contracts to all use identical-appearing commitments that enhance their privacy and the fungibility of all bitcoins. Spenders will enjoy lower fees and the ability to resolve many multisig scripts and complex contracts with the same efficiency, low fees, and large anonymity set as single-sig users. Taproot and schnorr also include efficiency improvements for full nodes such as the ability to batch signature verification. Together, the improvements lay the groundwork for future potential upgrades that may improve efficiency, privacy, and fungibility further.

On May 4th, [**Casa**](https://twitter.com/CasaHODL/status/1389591837556547593) co-founder Jameson Lopp published a short explainer and noted that "[once our software and hardware dependencies support Taproot functionality, we can integrate it into Casa](https://blog.keys.casa/what-is-taproot-bitcoin-upgrade/)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> At that point, we'll seek to make migrating to a Taproot-enabled wallet as painless as possible. The migration process will be quite similar to the regular transaction signing flows with which you are familiar, it will just create a transaction that moves funds into a Taproot-enabled address. There will be no rush to upgrade your wallet; you may do so at your own convenience.
>
> In addition to the default privacy benefits you'll get by upgrading to a Taproot-enabled wallet, we'll be exploring ways we can improve security for our clients with the new Taproot features.

On May 6th, **Galaxy Digital**'s [Amanda Fabiano](https://twitter.com/_amanda_fab) re-shared [a portion](https://twitter.com/_amanda_fab/status/1390424891980140544) of the research that she and [Rachel Rybarczyk](https://twitter.com/_rrybarczyk) had conducted earlier, published in [two](https://medium.com/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-mining/part-1-taproot-schnorr-and-its-impact-on-mining-a0509856307a) [parts](https://medium.com/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-mining/part-2-bitcoin-p2tr-transaction-breakdown-67b5a443554b), regarding Taproot, Schnorr, and mining. They argued that we should be wary of "two concepts that have come up in relation to fungibility: clean coins and green coins."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> 1. There is no distinction between the newly issued coins in a block and transaction fees in a block, which means that newly minted bitcoins are mixed with the coins paid by transactors in a block, which themselves may not be clean.
> 2. Pools currently assemble blocks, and the coin flow starts at the pools’ addresses. Depending on the pool, miners can see multiple hops of coin movement prior to the coins landing in their wallets — usually attributed to change addresses.
> 3. It also does not take into account the transaction fees, something that become increasingly significant as the block subsidy diminishes over time... So the bitcoin that is paid out to all miners includes block subsidies and transaction fees with a multitude of addresses with very different histories, all from different blocks.

They predict that "a Schnorr and Taproot activation will likely cause an increase in fees per block," and "because the Schnorr and Taproot upgrades obfuscate some of the details of the script execution, it makes it more difficult to label one bitcoin as being worth less than another bitcoin because it is more difficult to obtain an accurate understanding of a bitcoin’s spend history, thereby increasing network fungibility."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On May 13th, [Stephan Livera](https://twitter.com/stephanlivera/status/1392814620457332747) published an interview with **Braiins**' co-founder [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav) "to talk about signalling for Taproot as a miner" for [SLP275](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/275/). Earlier in the month, his company's pool had mined [the first block signaling support for Taproot](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/need-to-know-taproot-signaling). "It was a no-brainer, no pun intended."

## May 6th - HOLISTIC PRIVACY AND USABILITY

[**Nym Technologies**](https://twitter.com/nymproject/status/1392819435640172549) CEO [Harry Halpin](https://twitter.com/harryhalpin/status/1390346134841921538) published a paper titled '[Holistic Privacy and Usability of a Cryptocurrency Wallet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02793.pdf),' which focused on the results of tests "integrating the ZCash wallet into network-level protection like VPNs or Tor," within the framework of holistic privacy:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Unlike encryption that – given [a] mathematical hardness assumption – can be proven to keep confidentiality against even powerful enemies, privacy is not a binary property but a multi-dimensional and socially-embedded spectrum that can be realized in multiple ways, ranging from pseudonymity to anonymity. This especially holds true for third-party anonymity in technical systems, which have multiple layers where information may leak and so allow an adversary to link items of interest...
>
> The problem then facing the design of a usable anonymous cryptocurrency wallet is *holistic privacy*: Privacy is not reducible to a single layer of abstraction, and a leak at any layer can eliminate any privacy properties of the system as a whole. This problem is not confined to privacy-enhanced cryptocurrency wallets, but the hard problem of holistic privacy is endemic in the development of privacy-enhancing tools from web browsers like Tor to secure messaging applications like Signal. For example, Tor cannot interoperate with the popular Google Chrome browser due to the way it retrieves DNS without allowing a proxy like Tor, and Signal uses phone numbers for identities in a way that many activists feel uncomfortable with even though the Signal server itself uses advanced techniques so that it does not need to record the phone number itself [18]. Holistic privacy is likely always incomplete, as new bugs and layers of abstraction are discovered and more complex assemblages of programs created (in turn, altering their original privacy properties).

## May 8th - MALICIOUS TOR EXIT RELAYS, CONTINUED

In [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-9th---malicious-tor-exit-relays) and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-10th---tor-consensus-issue), I have been following issues with the Tor network and its effect on Bitcoin. According to a new follow-up post by security researcher and Tor server operator [Nusenu](https://nusenu.medium.com/tracking-one-year-of-malicious-tor-exit-relay-activities-part-ii-85c80875c5df), the attackher introducing malicious relays had "managed more than 27% of tor’s exit relay capacity" in February. "This is the largest malicious tor exit fraction I’ve ever observed by a single actor."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Nonetheless we are in a dilemma between knowingly using malicious tor exit relays vs. excluding them via the tor client configuration at the price of having a non-default configuration. This is additionally complicated by the fact that the exact nature of the attacks are not entirely known. We know about mitmproxy, sslstrip, bitcoin address rewrites and download modification attacks but it is not possible to rule out other types of attacks.

The simplest ways to protect yourself from these threats are to force [HTTPS-only](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) connections and to stay within the Tor network, which eliminates the need for exit nodes. Browser features like [Onion-Location](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-8th---hyperonionization) can help with this by redirecting you to the onion service version of websites you visit.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On May 5th, the [**Tor Project**](https://twitter.com/torproject/status/1389976266678235137) had launched a new page for checking "[the state of our major services](https://blog.torproject.org/check-status-of-tor-services)." On May 11th, they tweeted about their attempts to "[diagnose and reject bad relays](https://twitter.com/torproject/status/1392213543605309440)," and published [a list of rejected fingerprints](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/network-health/team/-/wikis/Rejected-fingerprints-found-in-attacks).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On May 13th, senior software engineer [Konstantin Darutkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darutkin) published [a report](https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/external-protocol-flooding/) about an unrelated "scheme flooding vulnerability" that affected all major browsers including Tor, though it "takes the longest to successfully run" there. "A website exploiting the scheme flooding vulnerability could create a stable and unique identifier that can link those browsing identities together."

Recently we have seen a number of integrations between Tor and Bitcoin infrastructure. On May 14th, [**Trezor**](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1393180786120175617) highlighted their Tor Switch feature, which they had introduced into their Suite as of [November 2020](https://blog.trezor.io/privacy-in-trezor-suite-introducing-the-tor-switch-ac787a1c1c65), and said that "we're planning to allow the user to enable Tor right on the login!" On May 17th, the [Ronin Dojo](https://twitter.com/RoninDojoUI/status/1394358001788612610) project published [a release](https://code.samourai.io/ronindojo/RoninDojo/-/releases/v1.10.0) adding "a new way to interact with your node remotely using Tor Browser." And on May 20th, [Sparrow Wallet](https://twitter.com/SparrowWallet/status/1395334662222921728) [v1.4.1](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases/tag/1.4.1) came with the option to "broadcast transactions over a new Tor circuit to an external service where Tor is enabled."

## May 13th - FINANCIAL FREEDOM AND PRIVACY

In [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-19th---civil-liberties-versus-digital-mercenaries), I featured the **Cato Institute**’s [38th Annual Monetary Conference](https://www.cato.org/events/38th-annual-monetary-conference) with a focus on “central bank vs. private (centralized and decentralized) digital currencies.” On May 13th, the center [announced](https://twitter.com/CatoCMFA/status/1392816867039928322) that their new "[Digital Currencies: Risk or Promise?](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/spring/summer-2021)" journal was online, including **Human Rights Foundation** (HRF) director [Alex Gladstein](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1392857330493001737)'s article, "[Financial Freedom and Privacy in the Post-Cash World](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/spring/summer-2021/financial-freedom-privacy-post-cash-world)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In “Cypherpunk’s Manifesto,” privacy activist Eric Hughes (1993) wrote: “We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.” The world seems destined to track toward the extinction of banknotes and an endgame of trackable and seizable CBDC and commercial money. In the post-cash world, there simply may not be very much financial freedom and privacy. In this context, bitcoin is worthy of continued study and exploration by monetary economists and human rights activists alike.

The paper covers CBDCs ([TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-27th---chimeras-of-central-bank-digital-currency)), Taproot ([TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-14th---bitcoin-core-v021-released), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-2nd---taproot-activation-meetings), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-2nd---recurring-taproot-meetings), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-15th---taproot-activation-specification-merged)), the third-party doctrine ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-15th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-2nd---eff-calls-for-coinbase-transparency), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-2nd---tax-authorities-demand-disclosures), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-17th---how-private-is-my-pay-app), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-9th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs-update), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-1st---irs-john-doe-summons-to-exchanges)), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and their 'Travel Rule' ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-20th---how-i-knew-your-customer-fatf-compliance), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-14th---fatf-report-on-red-flag-indicators), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-16th---know-your-customers-customer-kycc), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-19th---fatf-public-consultation-on-virtual-assets), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-20th---fatf-public-consultation-closes)), FinCEN and the Federal Reserve's proposed rule from October 2020 ([TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule)), and other topics within "the future of financial freedom and privacy."

## May 25th - TAPROOT SOFT FORK SIGNALLING REACHES THRESHOLD

Last month's [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-15th---taproot-activation-specification-merged) covered the merging of Taproot “speedy trial” activation parameters into the first release candidate of [Bitcoin Core 0.21.1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2021-April/000098.html). On [May 2nd](https://twitter.com/bitcoincoreorg/status/1388755385381801990), the [final release candidate](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2021-May/000099.html) with these mainnet and testnet activation parameters was published. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> If activated, these improvements will allow users of single-signature scripts, multisignature scripts, and complex contracts to all use identical-appearing commitments that enhance their privacy and the fungibility of all bitcoins. Spenders will enjoy lower fees and the ability to resolve many multisig scripts and complex contracts with the same efficiency, low fees, and large anonymity set as single-sig users. Taproot and schnorr also include efficiency improvements for full nodes such as the ability to batch signature verification. Together, the improvements lay the groundwork for future potential upgrades that may improve efficiency, privacy, and fungibility further.

On May 4th, [**Casa**](https://twitter.com/CasaHODL/status/1389591837556547593) co-founder Jameson Lopp published a short explainer and noted that "[once our software and hardware dependencies support Taproot functionality, we can integrate it into Casa](https://blog.keys.casa/what-is-taproot-bitcoin-upgrade/)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> At that point, we'll seek to make migrating to a Taproot-enabled wallet as painless as possible. The migration process will be quite similar to the regular transaction signing flows with which you are familiar, it will just create a transaction that moves funds into a Taproot-enabled address. There will be no rush to upgrade your wallet; you may do so at your own convenience.
>
> In addition to the default privacy benefits you'll get by upgrading to a Taproot-enabled wallet, we'll be exploring ways we can improve security for our clients with the new Taproot features.

On May 6th, **Galaxy Digital**'s [Amanda Fabiano](https://twitter.com/_amanda_fab) re-shared [a portion](https://twitter.com/_amanda_fab/status/1390424891980140544) of the research that she and [Rachel Rybarczyk](https://twitter.com/_rrybarczyk) had conducted earlier, published in [two](https://medium.com/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-mining/part-1-taproot-schnorr-and-its-impact-on-mining-a0509856307a) [parts](https://medium.com/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-mining/part-2-bitcoin-p2tr-transaction-breakdown-67b5a443554b), regarding Taproot, Schnorr, and mining. They argued that we should be wary of "two concepts that have come up in relation to fungibility: clean coins and green coins."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> 1. There is no distinction between the newly issued coins in a block and transaction fees in a block, which means that newly minted bitcoins are mixed with the coins paid by transactors in a block, which themselves may not be clean.
> 2. Pools currently assemble blocks, and the coin flow starts at the pools’ addresses. Depending on the pool, miners can see multiple hops of coin movement prior to the coins landing in their wallets — usually attributed to change addresses.
> 3. It also does not take into account the transaction fees, something that become increasingly significant as the block subsidy diminishes over time... So the bitcoin that is paid out to all miners includes block subsidies and transaction fees with a multitude of addresses with very different histories, all from different blocks.

They predict that "a Schnorr and Taproot activation will likely cause an increase in fees per block," and "because the Schnorr and Taproot upgrades obfuscate some of the details of the script execution, it makes it more difficult to label one bitcoin as being worth less than another bitcoin because it is more difficult to obtain an accurate understanding of a bitcoin’s spend history, thereby increasing network fungibility."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On May 13th, [Stephan Livera](https://twitter.com/stephanlivera/status/1392814620457332747) published an interview with **Braiins**' co-founder [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav) "to talk about signalling for Taproot as a miner" for [SLP275](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/275/). Earlier in the month, his company's pool had mined [the first block signalling support for Taproot](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/need-to-know-taproot-signaling). "It was a no-brainer, no pun intended." By May 21st, around [95% of potential hash rate share](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/95-miners-potentially-activating-taproot) was signalling. On May 25th, software engineer [Yihao Peng](https://twitter.com/Yihao_Peng/status/1397199906352283661) wrote about how [**BTC.COM**](http://btc.com/) enabled it in their pool deployment. "[Therefore, we should be able to see that almost all blocks from BTC.COM contain the taproot signal from this week and onwards](https://yihaopeng.medium.com/btc-com-taproot-signal-and-broken-miners-6f9626e10664)." As of this month's end, it appears that we are on route for [lock-in](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1398957585060012032) within the next two weeks, according to [Hampus Sjöberg](https://twitter.com/hampus_s/status/1387079347425644549)'s [taproot.watch](https://taproot.watch/) page.

## May 26th - OFAC SEEKING CHAINALYSIS SUBCRIPTION

The [U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control](https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.aspx/sdn/) (OFAC) published [their intent to purchase a subscription](https://sam.gov/opp/66a930dc510940e48f9719969b3beff7/view) from blockchain surveillance firm **Chainalysis**, whose tools claim to provide address clustering, transaction flow mapping and graphing, a wallet explorer, and "analysis of user behavior, exchange rate, trade, and market data."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is requesting a subscription to Chainalysis Inc.’s Chainalysis Rumker and subsequent Training and Support Packages for mission-critical research. OFAC requires a commercial online blockchain tracing web-based application tool to equip investigators in its Office of Global Targeting (OGT) to analyze and track virtual currency transactions e.g. Bitcoin, in order to gather attribution information on involved parties that OGT may put on the SDN List. This tool would specifically support cyber sanctions implementation undertaken by OFAC.  
>
> Chainalysis Rumker licenses include Observations and Nodes, which help locate where server nodes are running.  This license also includes Wasabi Demixing services at no additional cost to OFAC, and with no limits to the number of requests.  All Assets license includes every asset Chainalysis has coverage for today and will include any added in the future on a quarterly basis. The License also includes a dedicated Customer Success Manager to OFAC, and premium 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year support.
>
> Moreover, Chainalysis’ use by key industry, U.S. Government, and foreign partners necessitates OFAC’s use of the same tool to be able to collaborate easily and seamlessly with these partners in investigations and anti-money laundering and terrorist finance inquiries. Each automated blockchain tool in this space is distinctive given the variety of features and unique heuristics, algorithms, and data to which they have access.

While the notice was subsequently cancelled "in order to re-evaluate the requirement," it gives further insight into government attempts to track and control Bitcoin. I have previously covered similar contracts in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea), [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-11th---coinbase-contracting-with-secret-service-irs), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-4th---irs-still-seeking-to-trace-privacy-coins), and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-19th---civil-liberties-versus-digital-mercenaries).

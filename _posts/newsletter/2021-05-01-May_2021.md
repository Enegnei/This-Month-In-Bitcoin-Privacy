## May 8th - MALICIOUS TOR EXIT RELAYS, CONTINUED

In [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-9th---malicious-tor-exit-relays) and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-10th---tor-consensus-issue), I have been following issues with the Tor network and its effect on Bitcoin. According to a new follow-up post...

## May [day] - TAPROOT SOFT FORK SIGNALLING REACHES THRESHOLD

Last month's [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-15th---taproot-activation-specification-merged) covered the merging of Taproot “speedy trial” activation parameters into the first release candidate of [Bitcoin Core 0.21.1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2021-April/000098.html). On [May 2nd](https://twitter.com/bitcoincoreorg/status/1388755385381801990), the [final release candidate](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2021-May/000099.html) with these mainnet and testnet activation parameters was published.

> If activated, these improvements will allow users of single-signature scripts, multisignature scripts, and complex contracts to all use identical-appearing commitments that enhance their privacy and the fungibility of all bitcoins. Spenders will enjoy lower fees and the ability to resolve many multisig scripts and complex contracts with the same efficiency, low fees, and large anonymity set as single-sig users. Taproot and schnorr also include efficiency improvements for full nodes such as the ability to batch signature verification. Together, the improvements lay the groundwork for future potential upgrades that may improve efficiency, privacy, and fungibility further.

On May 6th, **Galaxy Digital**'s [Amanda Fabiano](https://twitter.com/_amanda_fab) re-shared [a portion](https://twitter.com/_amanda_fab/status/1390424891980140544) of the research that she and [Rachel Rybarczyk](https://twitter.com/_rrybarczyk) had conducted earlier, published in [two](https://medium.com/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-mining/part-1-taproot-schnorr-and-its-impact-on-mining-a0509856307a) [parts](https://medium.com/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-mining/part-2-bitcoin-p2tr-transaction-breakdown-67b5a443554b), regarding Taproot, Schnorr, and mining. They argued that we should be wary of "two concepts that have come up in relation to fungibility: clean coins and green coins."

> 1. There is no distinction between the newly issued coins in a block and transaction fees in a block, which means that newly minted bitcoins are mixed with the coins paid by transactors in a block, which themselves may not be clean.
> 2. Pools currently assemble blocks, and the coin flow starts at the pools’ addresses. Depending on the pool, miners can see multiple hops of coin movement prior to the coins landing in their wallets — usually attributed to change addresses.
> 3. It also does not take into account the transaction fees, something that become increasingly significant as the block subsidy diminishes over time... So the bitcoin that is paid out to all miners includes block subsidies and transaction fees with a multitude of addresses with very different histories, all from different blocks.

They predict that "a Schnorr and Taproot activation will likely cause an increase in fees per block," and "because the Schnorr and Taproot upgrades obfuscate some of the details of the script execution, it makes it more difficult to label one bitcoin as being worth less than another bitcoin because it is more difficult to obtain an accurate understanding of a bitcoin’s spend history, thereby increasing network fungibility."

## August 4th - UNDERSTANDING BITCOIN PRIVACY WITH OXT

[OXT Research](https://www.oxtresearch.com/) analyst [Ergo](https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC) began publishing [a four-part series](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1425428464702722049) on blockchain analytics and transaction privacy. The [first](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1423061852603535360) [part](https://medium.com/oxt-research/understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt-part-1-4-8177a40a5923) focuses on clarifying that Bitcoin is not anonymous but pseudonymous, and introducing various heuristics for categorising payments and detecting change; the second part, on "[the core concepts that underpin chain analysis](https://medium.com/oxt-research/understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt-part-2-4-20010e0dab97)," clustering, and how OXT’s transaction graph works; the third part, on "[the methods for undermining chain analysis](https://medium.com/oxt-research/understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt-part-3-4-9a1b2b572a8)," essentially by increasing ambiguity and uncertainty that a given interpretation about a transaction or wallet behaviour is accurate; and finally, the fourth part, on various features of **Samourai Wallet** that "[can be used to maintain privacy when interacting with bitcoin](https://medium.com/oxt-research/understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt-part-4-4-16cc0a8759d5)," including stealth addresses ([TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-15th---new-bip47-draft-and-paynym-torch), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-15th---signal-accepts-bitcoin-donations)), coin control, Ricochet ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-14th---samourai-wallet-address-reuse), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-1st---disjointed-services-flagging-mixed-coins)), STONEWALL ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-14th---samourai-wallet-address-reuse), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-24th---samourai-opens-beta-testing-for-soroban)), Stowaway aka PayJoin ([TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-5th---payjoin-support-in-wasabi-and-joinmarket)), and Whirlpool ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-7th---running-ronindojo)). I have previously included Ergo's research in [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-18th---dust-attacks) and [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-21st---financial-cancel-culture).

> It is likely that the typical user reading this guide is not looking to become an expert in chain analysis. Rather they are looking to improve their privacy when sending and receiving payments. The act of sending and receiving payments necessarily reveals UTXO set information about a sender’s wallet to a payment recipient. As a result, payment senders and receivers are able to evaluate the respective past and future spending of these known UTXOs, which can reveal additional information about their counterparty.
>
> Users armed with knowledge of chain analysis are better prepared for evaluating the implications of spending and receiving and can begin to take steps to protect their privacy.

## August 17th - ATOMIC SWAPS WITH MONERO, CONTINUED

In [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-8th---cross-chain-atomic-swaps-with-monero), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-16th---crowdfunding-atomic-swaps-with-monero), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-24th---farcaster-atomic-swaps-with-monero), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-23rd---testnet-atomic-swaps-with-monero), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-20th---atomic-swaps-with-monero-continued), and [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-1st---samourai-wallet-and-atomic-swaps), I have followed development of BTC-XMR atomic swap protocols, namely [Farcaster](https://github.com/farcaster-project) and the similar [Hoenisch / del Pino implementation](https://github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap). On August 17th, [**Opt Out**](https://twitter.com/optoutpod) [podcast](https://www.optoutpod.com/) host [Seth Simmons](https://sethforprivacy.com/about/) shared that he had "[just completed my first mainnet atomic swap (as the broker/XMR-seller)](https://twitter.com/sethforprivacy/status/1427615531130105856)." As a provider, he soon [published](https://twitter.com/sethforprivacy/status/1427674182767321092) a guide on [how to perform an atomic swap](https://sethforprivacy.com/guides/bitcoin-monero-atomic-swaps/) from bitcoin to Monero, using the Hoenisch / del Pino tool on Linux. At the time of writing, the ___'s latest release is [v0.8.2](https://github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap/releases/tag/0.8.2).

> The process took 34min, was done entirely over Tor, required no interaction by me, and was peer-to-peer with *no* middle-man or custodian.

Relatedly, on August 9th, in his [sixth episode](https://twitter.com/optoutpod/status/1424799143420211205), Simmons interviewed '[Diverter](https://twitter.com/Diverter_NoKYC)' about "the importance of hosting tools for friends, family, and online communities." And in his [seventh episode](https://twitter.com/optoutpod/status/1429533627210141696), he interviewed Paralelní Polis co-founder [Juraj](https://twitter.com/jurbed) [Bednar](https://juraj.bednar.io/en/about-me/) about "[what role Bitcoin plays in building up a parallel economy around us](https://www.optoutpod.com/parallel-econonomies-and-ethical-vekslaks-w-juraj/)."

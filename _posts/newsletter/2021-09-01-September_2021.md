## September 7th - EL SALVADOR CHIVO APP PRIVACY CONCERNS

## September 9th - MASTERCARD ACQUIRES CIPHERTRACE

[**Mastercard**](https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/september/mastercard-acquires-ciphertrace-to-enhance-crypto-capabilities/) [announced](https://twitter.com/MastercardNews/status/1435966760549715978) "an agreement to acquire CipherTrace, a leading cryptocurrency intelligence company with insight into more than 900 cryptocurrencies." They note that the "terms of the agreement were not disclosed, and the transaction is anticipated to close before the end of the year, pending certain conditions."

> As digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), become more intertwined with everyday activities — from the way people pay and get paid to how they invest — trust and security will be critical enablers to ensure broad adoption and scale. These new technologies will require new solutions and more powerful intelligence to ensure that the crypto economy is instilled with the same trust and peace of mind that consumers currently experience with more traditional payment methods.
> 
> The integrated offering will build on CipherTrace’s suite of digital assets and Mastercard’s cyber security solutions to provide businesses with greater transparency to help identify and understand their risks and to help manage their digital asset regulatory and compliance obligations."

In an [interview](https://old.coindesk.com/videos/recent-videos/ciphertrace-ceo-on-acquisition-by-mastercard) with [**CoinDesk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1436294960857354250) TV host [Christine Lee](https://twitter.com/christinenews), CEO [Dave Jevans](https://twitter.com/davejevans) shared that the [acquisition agreement](https://ciphertrace.com/mastercard-acquires-ciphertrace-to-enhance-crypto-capabilities/) "came about through many months of work," after assuming that **Mastercard** would remain either a customer or investor. While he did not reveal the acquisition amount, Lee noted that their competitor [**Chainalysis**](https://archive.is/zzlPY) had recently been valued at $2 billion. He claimed that they feel "very strongly about privacy, and I think Mastercard feels the same way. This is not in any way about exploiting privacy; this is really, like, increasing it."

In a later interview with [**Cointelegraph**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/adapt-or-die-payments-giants-partner-with-crypto-firms-to-ensure-security) reporter [Rachel Wolfson](https://twitter.com/Rachelwolf00/status/1440492886819102732), Jevans said that they offered "unique products, like ‘Armada’ for example, which integrates intelligence around crypto and banking transactions." According to [promotional](https://www.niceactimize.com/Lists/Brochures/ciphertrace_armada_brochure.pdf) [documents](https://ciphertrace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIPHERTRACE_DS-ARMADA-INSPECTOR-20201203.pdf) on Armada, which [launched](https://ciphertrace.com/virtual-asset-aml-risk-mitigation-for-financial-institutions/) in April 2020, it is "tightly integrated with leading AML tools including Nice Actimize, Caseware Alessa, BAE, Worldsys and Featurespace to identify VASP payments," and "visually displays VASP risk profiles based on KYC effectiveness, risky transactions, illicit activity." He anticipates that "all major payments companies will have to either acquire or partner with crypto intelligence firms to ensure digital asset development."

**CipherTrace** has previously been mentioned in: [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-8th---cross-chain-atomic-swaps-with-monero), regarding their development of tools for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to track Monero; [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule), regarding their membership in the U.S. Travel Rule Working Group (USTRWG); [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-7th---comply-first-think-later), regarding their contributions to a new online resource for anti-money laundering (AML) and compliance professionals; and [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-6th---signal-integrates-mobilecoin-sort-of), noting their partnership with digital forensics firm **Cellebrite**.

## September 28th - THE MORAL LANDSCAPE OF MONETARY DESIGN

Assistant professors [Andrew M. Bailey](http://twitter.com/resistancemoney), [Bradley Rettler](http://twitter.com/rettlerb), and [Craig Warmke](http://twitter.com/craigwarmke), who form the Bitcoin-focused research collective [Resistance Money](https://www.resistance.money/), published two new articles on the "philosophy, politics, and economics of cryptocurrency." The first part, '[Money Without State](https://andrewmbailey.com/MoneyWithoutState.pdf),' serves as an introduction to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and questions among other things "the orthodox status of the view that issuing money is a critical state function." The second part, '[The Moral Landscape of Monetary Design](https://www.resistance.money/MoralLandscape.pdf),' expands on the three of the four "key design dimensions along which cryptocurrencies differ – privacy, censorship-resistance, and consensus procedure."

> Despite widespread agreement on the value of privacy, financial privacy – that is, privacy with respect to buying, selling, and storing value – is not widely discussed or defended. As we'll see, though, it deserves renewed attention, especially in relation to cryptocurrencies.

CoinJoin, ring signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs are mentioned as ways to "transact... more privately." They also acknowledge that "the very privacy-enhancing features of cryptocurrencies that distinguish them from traditional forms of money could simultaneously help them fulfill traditional money roles," especially fungibility.

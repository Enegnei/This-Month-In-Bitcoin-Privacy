On September 15th, [WabiSabi testnet transaction](https://twitter.com/nopara73/status/1438182317588090886).

On September 21st, "[Pinpointing and Measuring Wasabi and Samourai CoinJoins in the Bitcoin Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10229.pdf)."

## September 7th - EL SALVADOR CHIVO APP PRIVACY CONCERNS

## September 9th - MASTERCARD ACQUIRES CIPHERTRACE

[**Mastercard**](https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/september/mastercard-acquires-ciphertrace-to-enhance-crypto-capabilities/) [announced](https://twitter.com/MastercardNews/status/1435966760549715978) "an agreement to acquire CipherTrace, a leading cryptocurrency intelligence company with insight into more than 900 cryptocurrencies." They note that the "terms of the agreement were not disclosed, and the transaction is anticipated to close before the end of the year, pending certain conditions."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> As digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), become more intertwined with everyday activities — from the way people pay and get paid to how they invest — trust and security will be critical enablers to ensure broad adoption and scale. These new technologies will require new solutions and more powerful intelligence to ensure that the crypto economy is instilled with the same trust and peace of mind that consumers currently experience with more traditional payment methods.
> 
> The integrated offering will build on CipherTrace’s suite of digital assets and Mastercard’s cyber security solutions to provide businesses with greater transparency to help identify and understand their risks and to help manage their digital asset regulatory and compliance obligations."

In an [interview](https://old.coindesk.com/videos/recent-videos/ciphertrace-ceo-on-acquisition-by-mastercard) with [**CoinDesk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1436294960857354250) TV host [Christine Lee](https://twitter.com/christinenews), CEO [Dave Jevans](https://twitter.com/davejevans) shared that the [acquisition agreement](https://ciphertrace.com/mastercard-acquires-ciphertrace-to-enhance-crypto-capabilities/) "came about through many months of work," after assuming that **Mastercard** would remain either a customer or investor. While he did not reveal the acquisition amount, Lee noted that their competitor [**Chainalysis**](https://archive.is/zzlPY) had recently been valued at $2 billion. He claimed that they feel "very strongly about privacy, and I think Mastercard feels the same way. This is not in any way about exploiting privacy; this is really, like, increasing it."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In a later interview with [**Cointelegraph**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/adapt-or-die-payments-giants-partner-with-crypto-firms-to-ensure-security) reporter [Rachel Wolfson](https://twitter.com/Rachelwolf00/status/1440492886819102732), Jevans said that they offered "unique products, like ‘Armada’ for example, which integrates intelligence around crypto and banking transactions." According to [promotional](https://www.niceactimize.com/Lists/Brochures/ciphertrace_armada_brochure.pdf) [documents](https://ciphertrace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIPHERTRACE_DS-ARMADA-INSPECTOR-20201203.pdf) on Armada, which [launched](https://ciphertrace.com/virtual-asset-aml-risk-mitigation-for-financial-institutions/) in April 2020, it is "tightly integrated with leading AML tools including Nice Actimize, Caseware Alessa, BAE, Worldsys and Featurespace to identify VASP payments," and "visually displays VASP risk profiles based on KYC effectiveness, risky transactions, illicit activity." He anticipates that "all major payments companies will have to either acquire or partner with crypto intelligence firms to ensure digital asset development."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**CipherTrace** has previously been mentioned in: [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-8th---cross-chain-atomic-swaps-with-monero), regarding their development of tools for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to track Monero; [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule), regarding their membership in the U.S. Travel Rule Working Group (USTRWG); [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-7th---comply-first-think-later), regarding their contributions to a new online resource for anti-money laundering (AML) and compliance professionals; and [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-6th---signal-integrates-mobilecoin-sort-of), noting their partnership with digital forensics firm **Cellebrite**.

## September 14th - HRF GRANTS TO CHAINCASE, JOINMARKET FOR UMBREL

## September 16th - COINBASE ON ICE

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea), [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-11th---coinbase-contracting-with-secret-service-irs), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-2nd---eff-calls-for-coinbase-transparency), and [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-21st---coinbase-releases-transparency-report), I have followed records of **Coinbase**'s contractual relationships with, and data disclosures to, government agencies, many of which can be conveniently viewed through [**Tech Inquiry**](https://techinquiry.org/explorer/vendor/coinbase%2C%20inc./)'s lobbying and procurement explorer. In August and September, they were awarded two contracts for Analytics licenses from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) branch of Homeland Security, valued overall at $29,000 and $1,365,000 respectively. The former smaller contract is categorised under the product/ service code "DA01: IT AND TELECOM - BUSINESS APPLICATION/APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT SERVICES (LABOR)," and the second larger contract under "DA10: IT AND TELECOM - BUSINESS APPLICATION/APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Beyond that, it is not stated how they plan to use the platform. But there are indications that the focus of its use will involve the War on Drugs. In March 2017, during a U.S. House of Representatives [subcommittee hearing on the opiod crisis](https://web.archive.org/web/20210302010759/https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Speech/2017/170321allen.pdf), Investigative Programs assistant director Matthew C. Allen stated:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> ICE recognizes that the private sector represents America’s first line of defense against money laundering. Through our Illicit Finance and Proceeds of Crime Unit (IFPCU), ICE partners with the U.S. financial industry, along with state and federal agencies, to combat financial and trade crimes associated with heroin and fentanyl smuggling and distribution. In targeting virtual currency transactions of heroin and illicit fentanyl, ICE uses blockchain analysis to track transactions between criminal parties.

In their [budget overview](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211041500/https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/7_u.s._immigration_and_customs_enforcement.pdf) for fiscal year 2021, ICE wrote:

> The [Bulk Cash Smuggling Center] BCSC has developed a Cryptocurrency Intelligence Program (CIP) which identifies unlicensed money services businesses in the form of independent cryptocurrency brokers’ use of peer-to-peer (P2P) sites, online forums and classified advertisements, and darknet markets (DNM) to engage in unlicensed money services businesses (MSB) activity. A large portion of these unlicensed MSBs are engaged in laundering narcotics proceeds, including opioid trafficking.

As I explained in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea), Coinbase Analytics is a re-branding of the blockchain surveillance company Neutrino, which they acquired in February 2019. Hacking Team co-founder Alberto Ornaghi, who described himself as a "Senior Software Engineer" at Coinbase from February to July 2019 in his LinkedIn profile, is now a [technical advisor](https://archive.is/sRcNK) to Credmark, a tokenised "[risk modeling platform in the DeFi space](https://archive.is/7Yc6M)."

## September 19th - BISQ TRANSITIONS TO TOR V3

Since [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-3rd---removing-tor-v2-support), [**Bisq**](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1442852409181720579) has been prompting users to upgrade to Tor v3 addresses. This month, they [merged](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5686) [bitcoinj](https://bitcoinj.org/) support for Tor v3 as part of release [version 1.7.4](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.7.4), which "enables you to connect to a Bitcoin Core node with a Tor v3 address." They plan to [phase out support for Tor v2 addresses](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1442852606301257729) after October 15th.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On September 21st, Johannes Kepler University Linz assistant [Tobias Höller](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-networks-and-security/about-us/ins-team/hoeller-tobias/) published a guest post for the [**Tor Project**](https://twitter.com/torproject/status/1440417291196190722) on "[V3 onion services usage](https://blog.torproject.org/v3-onion-services-usage)," on which he had recently [co-authored a paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3473604.3474565). He also explains the privacy improvements:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> For V2 onion services, the data published in the hidden service directory is uploaded in plain text, meaning that the Tor relays with the HSDir flag can learn a lot of information about a small fraction of running V2 onion services (most importantly the onion address) every day.
> 
> ... V3 uses encryption and key derivation to address this issue. Since the V3 address is itself a public key, all the data uploaded to the hidden service directory can be encrypted. Clients can always decrypt that data with the key embedded in the .onion address. However, clients still need to ask the directory for information about a specific onion address, which would again allow mass collection of onion addresses. With V3 onion services, this is prevented by using key derivation to derive a daily-rotated identifier ("blinded public key").
> 
> ... Thanks to these improvements, V3 onion services leak much less sensitive information.

## September 21st - CHAINALYSIS OPERATING BLOCK EXPLORER

[**CoinDesk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1440371592081543177) writer [Danny Nelson](https://twitter.com/realDannyNelson) reported that "[according to leaked documents reviewed by CoinDesk, Chainalysis, the largest of the blockchain tracing firms, owns and operates](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/21/leaked-slides-show-how-chainalysis-flags-crypto-suspects-for-cops/)" the blockchain explorer website [walletexplorer.com](https://archive.is/B3scu). The documents, supposedly from a "Chainalysis presentation to Italian police investigating the dark web," claim that the site "‘scrapes’ the IP addresses of suspicious" visitors, which is then used to "provide law enforcement with meaningful leads related to the IP data associated with an address."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The website's creator didn't exactly hide his association with the company. Both the homepage and [FAQ](https://archive.is/vFnOL) are credited to [Aleš Janda](https://archive.is/tUJDd), a Prague-based researcher whose website and [LinkedIn](https://cz.linkedin.com/in/alesjanda) note that he is a graduate of the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://fel.cvut.cz/cz/) (ČVUT) and has worked for **Chainalysis** since September 2015, around the time that he gave a presentation at a [Paralelní Polis meetup](https://www.slideshare.net/paralelnipolis/deanonymizace-blockchainu). He describes the explorer as "a deanonymization tool... [but] since I've been at Chainalysis, it hasn't been maintained much."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

If you are not interested in running your own block explorer to avoid such snoops, the least you can do is look up your addresses through services that work over Tor or even host an onion, such as [blockstream.info](https://blockstream.info) ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-8th---hyperonionization)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## September 23rd - SAMOURAI LIKE-TYPE CHANGE OUTPUT FEATURE

[**Samourai Wallet**](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1441052845206294535) released version [0.99.97a](https://docs.samourai.i.o/en/wallet/releases#v09997a) with at least two relevant privacy-related improvements. First, the "like type" change output feature for post-mix spends will make it harder for analysts to [distinguish between payment and change](https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Change_address_detection) following a CoinJoin. Second, they have enabled "local receive address indexes to help prevent unintentional address reuse during high network latency or interruption." While it is not cited, this may be related to [a vulnerability disclosure](https://medium.com/@thepiratewhocantbenamed/samourai-wallet-address-reuse-bug-1d64d311983d) from last year ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-14th---samourai-wallet-address-reuse)), which found "a lack of error handling... where the client receives malformed data or any network connection disruption occurs" and recommendeded "persist[ing] the relevant wallet indexes locally in the same manner the Whirlpool desktop client does."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On the same day, [**Sparrow Wallet**](https://twitter.com/SparrowWallet/status/1441049974934892553) released version [1.5.0](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases/tag/1.5.0). In addition to incorporating pre-send privacy analysis tips and Belcher's anti-fee-sniping protection proposal ([TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-10th---improving-off-chain-protocol-privacy)), it also includes [STONEWALL](https://samouraiwallet.com/stonewall)-type transactions, which will be "[the default for postmix sends](https://twitter.com/SparrowWallet/status/1441052972524449792)," and a compatible implementation of Whirlpool to perform CoinJoins, for which there is a detailed [setup guide](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/docs/mixing-whirlpool.html).

## September 28th - THE MORAL LANDSCAPE OF MONETARY DESIGN

Assistant professors [Andrew M. Bailey](http://twitter.com/resistancemoney), [Bradley Rettler](http://twitter.com/rettlerb), and [Craig Warmke](http://twitter.com/craigwarmke), who form the Bitcoin-focused research collective [Resistance Money](https://www.resistance.money/), published two new articles on the "philosophy, politics, and economics of cryptocurrency." The first part, '[Money Without State](https://andrewmbailey.com/MoneyWithoutState.pdf),' serves as an introduction to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and questions among other things "the orthodox status of the view that issuing money is a critical state function." The second part, '[The Moral Landscape of Monetary Design](https://www.resistance.money/MoralLandscape.pdf),' expands on three of the four "key design dimensions along which cryptocurrencies differ – privacy, censorship-resistance, and consensus procedure."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Despite widespread agreement on the value of privacy, financial privacy – that is, privacy with respect to buying, selling, and storing value – is not widely discussed or defended. As we'll see, though, it deserves renewed attention, especially in relation to cryptocurrencies.

CoinJoin, ring signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs are mentioned as ways to "transact... more privately." They also acknowledge that "the very privacy-enhancing features of cryptocurrencies that distinguish them from traditional forms of money could simultaneously help them fulfill traditional money roles," especially fungibility.

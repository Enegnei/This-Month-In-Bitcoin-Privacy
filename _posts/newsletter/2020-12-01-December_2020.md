## December 1st - PRIVACY ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES SYMPOSIUM

The [third submission deadline](https://petsymposium.org/cfp21.php) for the upcoming 21st [**Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium**](https://twitter.com/PET_Symposium/status/1329807864551141377) (PETS 2021) has now passed. If you would still be interested in publishing your research here, the final issue submission deadline is set for February 28th 2021. This [open-access journal](https://dblp.org/db/journals/popets/index.html) and conference has been accepting papers regarding "blockchain technologies applied to privacy / blockchain privacy" since their [19th symposium](https://petsymposium.org/cfp19.php).

## December 2nd - TAPROOT RING SIGNATURES

Developer [Jonas Nick](https://twitter.com/n1ckler/status/1334240709814136833) published a proof-of-concept [ring signature scheme for Taproot outputs](https://github.com/jonasnick/taproot-ringsig).

## December 3rd - FINANCIAL CRYPTOGRAPHY 2021

[Notifications for paper submissions](http://fc21.ifca.ai/cfp.html) to next year's 25th annual [Financial Cryptography and Data Security](http://fc21.ifca.ai/) (FC21) conference were sent out. One of the [accepted papers](https://twitter.com/bhaslhofer/status/1334753000611602432) concerns "[the first quantitative analysis of the security and privacy issues opened up by cross-layer interactions" with "data from the Bitcoin blockchain and the LN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00764)," published back in [July](https://twitter.com/bhaslhofer/status/1278957134252826624). It was authored by [Matteo Romiti](https://twitter.com/MattRomiti), [Friedhelm Victor](https://twitter.com/friedhelmvictor), [Pedro Moreno-Sanchez](https://twitter.com/pedrorechez), [Bernhard Haslhofer](https://twitter.com/bhaslhofer), and [Matteo Maffei](https://twitter.com/matteo_maffei).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On the same day, co-author [Haslhofer](https://twitter.com/bhaslhofer/status/1334493452277575681) also shared that the [Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at/) (AIT) and the [Vienna Complexity Science Hub](https://www.csh.ac.at/complexity-science/Cryptofinance/) were "joining forces and aim at building an interdisciplinary team of scientists focusing on the analysis of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols and services." They are looking to fill [part-time PhD](https://www.csh.ac.at/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PhD-Decentralized-Finance_final.pdf) and [partner scientist](https://jobs.ait.ac.at/Job/139799) positions.

## December 8th - COINSWAP IMPLEMENTATION ON TESTNET

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund) and [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-11th---design-sketch-for-first-version-of-coinswap), I covered the early development of [CoinSwap](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinSwap). Chris Belcher has since conducted "[the first ever multi-transaction CoinSwap on bitcoin testnet](https://twitter.com/chris_belcher_/status/1336322923800322049)." On December 14th, he also published a Rust implementation "[for developers to play around with](https://github.com/bitcoin-teleport/teleport-transactions)."

## December 10th - EXPLAIN TAPROOT PRIVACY

In [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-27th---taproots-impact-on-bitcoin-privacy) I covered discussion about the privacy benefits of the upcoming Schnorr / Taproot soft fork. [**Braiins**](https://twitter.com/slush_pool/status/1337054726920302592), operator of the oldest Bitcoin mining pool, published a "[not overly-technical description of how blockchain analysis works and the implications of Taproot on Bitcoin user privacy](https://braiins.com/blog/explain-like-im-not-a-developer-taproot-privacy)," with suggestions for "meaningful adoption." The first half of the article breaks down UTXOs and clustering.

> A great start would be exchanges using Taproot in mass, which they are incentivized to do considering that they are likely the most active users of multi-sig transactions which are made cheaper by Taproot. If exchanges do their part, it’s up to wallet service providers to also implement Taproot for their users, so that multi-sig exchange withdrawals to single-sig users are not distinguishable on-chain.
>
> This all starts with education. Most new adopters of Bitcoin will likely never know or care about address types and other technical aspects of the network. But we are the early adopters, the vocal and powerful minority in the future Bitcoin ecosystem. It is up to us to follow best practices, educate others, and support service providers who help move Bitcoin forward.

## December 12th - WASABI WALLET 2.0 UPDATE

In [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-5th---wasabi-wallet-20), I covered [**Wasabi**](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1338155867972177921)'s announcement of their next-generation wallet software with "a complete UI redesign and significant UX improvements." This month, Ficsór provided [more information on the status of the work](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-wallet-2-update/) and a preview of the new interface, still estimating that the release will be ready in 8 to 9 months.

> We're currently trying to [come to consensus](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/pull/88) on just how many of our ideas we should include in the first version. But what I can already say, is that our starting results are miraculous: we are already able to create coinjoins that are both orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than Wasabi 1.0 coinjoins. Red changes will rarely be created, nor will there be a need to have a minimum amount to coinjoin anymore. At last, the UTXO set of wallets will be more diverse and coinjoins won't inflate the number of coins in wallets anymore.

Regarding WabiSabi, they are "still awaiting peer review from the Academic community."

## December 14th - USER EXPERIENCE RESEARCH GRANT

[**Square Crypto**](https://twitter.com/sqcrypto/status/1338529455636172803) announced their 20th grant to UX designer [Patrícia Estevão](https://twitter.com/patestevao/status/1338540274629349377).

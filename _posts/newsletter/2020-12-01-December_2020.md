## December 1st - PRIVACY ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES SYMPOSIUM

The [third submission deadline](https://petsymposium.org/cfp21.php) for the upcoming 21st [**Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium**](https://twitter.com/PET_Symposium/status/1329807864551141377) (PETS 2021) has now passed. If you would still be interested in publishing your research here, the final issue submission deadline is set for February 28th 2021. This [open-access journal](https://dblp.org/db/journals/popets/index.html) and conference has been accepting papers regarding "blockchain technologies applied to privacy / blockchain privacy" since their [19th symposium](https://petsymposium.org/cfp19.php).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## December 2nd - TAPROOT RING SIGNATURES

Developer [Jonas Nick](https://twitter.com/n1ckler/status/1334240709814136833) published a proof-of-concept [ring signature scheme for Taproot outputs](https://github.com/jonasnick/taproot-ringsig). Ring signatures are a type of digital signature "[which makes it possible to specify a set of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45682-1_32)." Ring confidential transactions (RingCTs) have been [mandatory](https://github.com/monero-project/monero#monero-software-updates-and-consensus-protocol-changes-hard-fork-schedule) in Monero since 2017.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-27th---taproots-impact-on-bitcoin-privacy) I covered discussion about the privacy benefits of the upcoming Schnorr / Taproot soft fork. Journalist [Aaron van Wirdum](https://twitter.com/AaronvanW/status/1328385587011874820) has been tracking miner support for Taproot activation since last month; around 90% of the global hashrate has signalled support in some way. On December 10th, [**Braiins**](https://twitter.com/slush_pool/status/1337054726920302592), operator of the oldest Bitcoin mining pool, published a "[not overly-technical description of how blockchain analysis works and the implications of Taproot on Bitcoin user privacy](https://braiins.com/blog/explain-like-im-not-a-developer-taproot-privacy)." The first half of the article breaks down UTXOs and clustering.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> A great start would be exchanges using Taproot in mass, which they are incentivized to do considering that they are likely the most active users of multi-sig transactions which are made cheaper by Taproot. If exchanges do their part, it’s up to wallet service providers to also implement Taproot for their users, so that multi-sig exchange withdrawals to single-sig users are not distinguishable on-chain.
>
> This all starts with education. Most new adopters of Bitcoin will likely never know or care about address types and other technical aspects of the network. But we are the early adopters, the vocal and powerful minority in the future Bitcoin ecosystem. It is up to us to follow best practices, educate others, and support service providers who help move Bitcoin forward.

## December 3rd - PRIVACY IN CROSS-LAYER INTERACTIONS

[Notifications for paper submissions](http://fc21.ifca.ai/cfp.html) to next year's 25th annual [Financial Cryptography and Data Security](http://fc21.ifca.ai/) (FC21) conference were sent out. One of the [accepted papers](https://twitter.com/bhaslhofer/status/1334753000611602432) concerns "[the first quantitative analysis of the security and privacy issues opened up by cross-layer interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00764)" on Bitcoin, published back in [July](https://twitter.com/bhaslhofer/status/1278957134252826624). It was authored by [Matteo Romiti](https://twitter.com/MattRomiti), [Friedhelm Victor](https://twitter.com/friedhelmvictor), [Pedro Moreno-Sanchez](https://twitter.com/pedrorechez), [Bernhard Haslhofer](https://twitter.com/bhaslhofer), and [Matteo Maffei](https://twitter.com/matteo_maffei).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On the same day, co-author [Haslhofer](https://twitter.com/bhaslhofer/status/1334493452277575681) also shared that the [Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at/) (AIT) and the [Vienna Complexity Science Hub](https://www.csh.ac.at/complexity-science/Cryptofinance/) were "joining forces and aim at building an interdisciplinary team of scientists focusing on the analysis of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols and services." They are looking to fill [part-time PhD](https://www.csh.ac.at/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PhD-Decentralized-Finance_final.pdf) and [partner scientist](https://jobs.ait.ac.at/Job/139799) positions.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[István András Seres](https://twitter.com/Istvan_A_Seres), a co-developer of [WabiSabi](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-11th---wabisabi-and-coinpool), has been working on the '[security and privacy](https://github.com/seresistvanandras/lnbook/blob/lnsecurityprivacy/security_privacy_ln.asciidoc#definitions-of-privacy)' page of '[*Mastering the Lightning Network*](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook).' As I have previously covered in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-22nd---zkchannels-for-second-layer-privacy), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-3rd---junk-in-the-trunc-lightning-privacy), and [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-29th---like-a-clboss-lightning-privacy), many people have been critically examining the Lightning Network's privacy guarantees.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## December 7th - COMPLY FIRST, THINK LATER

[ComplyFirst](https://twitter.com/Comply_First/status/1336390530528317447) [launched](https://www.newswire.com/news/complyfirst-launches-to-support-crypto-exchange-compliance-with-21273457) this month as a new "online resource for anti-money laundering (AML) and other digital assets-related compliance professionals," with contributions from [Tari Labs](https://tarilabs.com/), [DV Chain](https://dvchain.co/), Stoic Capital, and the blockchain surveillance firm [**CipherTrace**](https://ciphertrace.com).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> We aim to educate and support various members of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including exchanges, wallets, custodians, developers, researchers, and more on supporting these valid, valuable and rapidly emerging technologies in a responsible manner that satisfies their compliance obligations.

One of their first [resources](https://www.complyfirst.org/resources/), published on December 7th, is "[Example Privacy Feature Enhanced Due Diligence Questionnaire](https://web.archive.org/web/20201213192152/https://s33483.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ComplyFirst-Example-Privacy-Feature-Enhanced-Due-Diligence-Questionnaire.pdf)," intended to be sent to customers and counterparties that "may be involved with privacy-enhancing activities such as mixing services, shielded transactions, or other unusual privacy-enhancing behaviors." Some of the questions include:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Describe your process of using a privacy-enhancing feature to the best of your ability:
>
> Describe why you are using a privacy-enhancing feature:
> 
> What cryptocurrency addresses did you use before/during/after (as applicable) the privacy-enhancing feature?
>
> If the privacy-enhancing process was interactive, did you conduct due diligence (eg: collect IDs,physical addresses, etc.) or otherwise know any of the counterparties you interacted with to use this privacy-enhancing feature? If so, provide as much information as possible, including names and wallet addresses:
>
> Do you intend to use these or similar privacy-enhancing features in the future? If so, why?

Honestly, this questionaire is far too long. In fact, [I laughed so hard that I struggled to even read it](https://youtu.be/KuVLQGMTfnE?t=651). If they would like a more succinct version, while keeping the original spirit of the document, I would re-write it as: "*Hey there! I see that you want to preserve your financial privacy. Do you mind if we just strip it away completely? If your answer is 'yes,' please keep in mind that you might never get your money back*. :smiley:" Ask me for the identities of relay operators along my Tor onion circuit, why don'tcha?
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## December 8th - COINSWAP ON TESTNET

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund) and [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-11th---design-sketch-for-first-version-of-coinswap), I covered the early development of [CoinSwap](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinSwap). Chris Belcher has since conducted "[the first ever multi-transaction CoinSwap on bitcoin testnet](https://twitter.com/chris_belcher_/status/1336322923800322049)." On December 14th, he also published a Rust implementation "[for developers to play around with](https://github.com/bitcoin-teleport/teleport-transactions)," along with a detailed roadmap for development.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## December 10th - THE PATRIOT ACT: SHARE IT ALL

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a news release titled "[Director Blanco Emphasizes Importance of Information Sharing Among Financial Institutions](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/director-blanco-emphasizes-importance-information-sharing-among-financial)." As part of these [prepared remarks](https://www.fincen.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-fincen-director-kenneth-blanco-delivered-virtually-american-bankers) for the ABA’s annual Financial Crimes Enforcement Conference, it was accompanied by [a fact sheet](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/314bfactsheet.pdf) on Section 314(b) of the [USA PATRIOT Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act provides financial institutions with the ability to share information with one another, under a safe harbor that offers protections from liability, in order to better identify and report activities that may involve money laundering or terrorist activities.  Participation in information sharing pursuant to Section 314(b) is voluntary, and FinCEN strongly encourages financial institutions to participate.

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-20th---how-i-knew-your-customer-fatf-compliance) and [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule), I covered the development of an inter-VASP customer data sharing system for compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Travel Rule, and how FinCEN was seeking to lower the threshold (a proposal for which they received "roughly 2,900 comments"); in [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-15th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-2nd---eff-calls-for-coinbase-transparency) and [TMIBPO06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-17th---how-private-is-my-pay-app), I've followed challenges to the use of the third-party doctrine regarding financial records; in [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), I also highlighted how the effectiveness of anti-money laundering policies came under scrutiny with the release of the '[FinCEN Files](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/)', and interest in identifying '[crypto-exposed persons](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-19th---chainalysis-and-crypto-exposed-persons).'
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

According to the fact sheet, financial institutions "need not have specific information indicating that the activity... relates to proceeds of [specified unlawful activities] SUA... nor must a financial institution or association have reached a conclusive determination that the activity is suspicious." Furthermore, the "regulations impose no limitations on the sharing of personally identifiable information." In an interview with [**CoinDesk**](https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-encourages-banks-to-share-customer-information-with-each-other), associate law professor Nizan Geslevich Packin, author of a pending paper on "[data aggregators’ relationships with banks, tech companies, and consumers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3620025)," said this is "a major concern."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> This has led to what one compliance officer called an "avalanche of data" because financial institutions have been filing more and more to FinCEN. 
>
> "Many questions about the safety of the information collected by FinCEN, as well as the bureau’s failure to provide clear guidelines regarding how and when it eventually deletes the data it has, remain unanswered,” Packin said. “This is concerning ... in an era in which cybersecurity [has] become a major concern."

On December 18th, Director Kenneth Blanco filed [a notice of proposed rulemaking](https://web.archive.org/web/20201218212406/https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28437.pdf) "to require banks and money service businesses ('MSBs') to submit reports, keep records, and verify the identity of customers in relation to transactions involving convertible virtual currency ('CVC') or digital assets with legal tender status ('legal tender digital assets' or 'LTDA') held in unhosted wallets" when the transaction is valued "above the equivalent of $3,000." The document notes that they would be limiting the notice-and-comment period to fifteen days "because this proposal involves a foreign affairs function of the United States" and must not have "undue delay in the implementation." [**Coin Center**](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1340061691833446403) [commented](https://www.coincenter.org/a-midnight-rule-for-cryptocurrency-transaction-reports/) that "rushing this rule" was "problematic," and "time constraints of the so-called midnight period should never be an acceptable justification for imposing rules on Americans and innovative American businesses."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Make no mistake, CTRs are a form of warrantless search and seizure of private financial records. Fifty years ago, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the constitutionality of these reporting requirements, arguing that Americans lose their right to a warrant with individual suspicion when they hand their private information over to third parties. We’ve [written extensively](https://www.coincenter.org/electronic-cash-decentralized-exchange-and-the-constitution/) why the continued constitutionality of these policies is in doubt.

On December 1st, [**Elliptic**](https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1333770216375980041) had published the '[takeaways](https://archive.vn/K8I2Y)' from [a conversation](https://archive.vn/4cvQ0) between their CEO [Simone Maini](https://archive.vn/NmwRZ) and Blanco. He claimed that FinCEN "has received 96,000 crypto-related SARs since 2013." Maini warned that "it’s best to stay on FinCEN’s good side and be proactive in following their guidance."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> “If you do business in whole or in substantial part in the United States, you fall under our regulations. Period,” Director Blanco said. “If you’ve got to think about it, that means you fall under our regulations and we expect not only that you’re going to register, but that you’re going to comply with all the AML/CFT obligations in the United States.”
>
> Director Blanco’s message was clear: crypto businesses need to ask for permission, not forgiveness, when expanding into new markets and business lines. 
>
> “Asking for forgiveness is going to be a big problem,” he said.

Of course, the original American [patriots](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patriot) who protested [general searches of private property and invasions of privacy](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment) by the British asked neither for permission nor forgiveness.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On December 9th, Congressmen [Warren Davidson](https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1336804544320327683), [Tom Emmer](https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer), [Ted Budd](https://twitter.com/RepTedBudd), and [Scott Perry](https://twitter.com/RepScottPerry) wrote a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin "regarding reports that the Treasury Department is considering issuing regulations that would restrict the use of self-hosted wallets."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The contemplated regulation would not meaningfully support law enforcement, while it would raise privacy concerns and place impractical regulatory burdens on digital asset users and companies... Eliminating the middleman through the use of self-hosted wallets means that consumers can maintain privacy and transact freely, which is critically important as individuals increasingly conduct their financial lives digitially. Such freedom stands in stark contrast to China's digital yuan, where citizens' transactions are surveilled and transactions involving disfavored individuals or activities can be censored."

On December 21st, Bitcoin developer [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1341084526123102208), the [**Electronic Frontier Foundation**](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/us-government-targeting-cryptocurrency-expand-reach-its-financial-surveillance), and [**Kraken**](https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1341082074107752448) published similar objections to FinCEN's proposed rulemaking, focusing on the detrimental effects to privacy and open access:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Twenty-five percent of the U.S. population is currently unbanked or underbanked. Sadly, existing requirements do indeed prohibit financial institutions from opening accounts for homeless people, refugees and others in this 25% who do not have enough money to afford a mailing address.
>
> Existing requirements do, however, permit them to receive money from those who can afford to pay account maintenance fees and live in neighborhoods that attract physical branches. The proposed rule would go beyond existing requirements to literally outlaw people sending money to the less fortunate using their financial institutions.
>
> The proposed rule does not just reserve today’s financial system for the wealthy. It also seeks to wall off tomorrow’s financial system from the poor. Beyond just prohibiting transactions with humans without home addresses, the proposed rule would prohibit financial institutions from sending virtual currency to smart contracts, which have no name or physical location to begin with.

On the same day, it was [reported](https://archive.is/8FHWW) by Senator [Ron Wyden](https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1341417455541837828) that the Treasury Department had "suffered a serious breach, beginning in July, the full depth of which isn’t known," though "dozens of email accounts were compromised,” including those of "the most senior officials." Wyden noted that this should "put an end to any plan that weakens encryption."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[**Fight For The Future**](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1341778531026649088) launched [a submission system for sending comments to FinCEN](https://www.stopfinancialsurveillance.org/).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## December 12th - WASABI WALLET 2.0 UPDATE

In [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-5th---wasabi-wallet-20), I covered [**Wasabi**](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1338155867972177921)'s announcement of their next-generation wallet software with "a complete UI redesign and significant UX improvements." This month, Ficsór provided [more information on the status of the work](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-wallet-2-update/) and a preview of the new interface, still estimating that the release will be ready in 8 to 9 months.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> We're currently trying to [come to consensus](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/pull/88) on just how many of our ideas we should include in the first version. But what I can already say, is that our starting results are miraculous: we are already able to create coinjoins that are both orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than Wasabi 1.0 coinjoins. Red changes will rarely be created, nor will there be a need to have a minimum amount to coinjoin anymore. At last, the UTXO set of wallets will be more diverse and coinjoins won't inflate the number of coins in wallets anymore.

Regarding WabiSabi, they are "still awaiting peer review from the Academic community." Ficsór talked more about these "UI and protocol changes" in Wasabi, as well as base layer changes coming to Bitcoin, on [episode #112](https://www.unhashedpodcast.com/episodes/wasabi-wallet-privacy-adam-ficsor) of the [**Unhashed**](https://twitter.com/UnhashedPodcast/status/1334901697064411137) podcast.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## December 14th - USER EXPERIENCE RESEARCH GRANT

[**Square Crypto**](https://twitter.com/sqcrypto/status/1338529455636172803) announced their 20th grant to UX designer [Patrícia Estevão](https://twitter.com/patestevao/status/1338540274629349377), to "help answer fundamental questions about how bitcoin is used to guide future design and development decisions." Estevão has previously published several infographics and [videos](https://twitter.com/patestevao/status/1154117549547823104) related to Bitcoin privacy, including '[Privacy and UTXO](https://web.archive.org/web/20201109023450/https://www.bitcoindesigned.com/infographics/privacy-and-utxo-part-1/),' '[Privacy and Light Wallets](https://twitter.com/patestevao/status/1045393299966775296),' and '[Wasabi Wallet](https://patestevao.com/work/wasabi/).' The results of her research will appear in the [Bitcoin Design Guide](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Guide).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## December 16th - COINKITE BITCOIN SCHOOL: JOINMARKET

[**Coinkite**](https://twitter.com/COLDCARDwallet/status/1339299857509609474) published another installment of their educational video series: "[How To Use JoinMarket - Bitcoin Privacy Software](https://youtu.be/9COdlsh4inY)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## December 20th - LEDGER DATA DUMP

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-29th---ledger-data-breach), I covered the discovery of a data breach from the [e-commerce and marketing database(s)](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015559320-E-commerce-and-Marketing-data-breach-FAQ) of hardware wallet company [**Ledger**](https://www.ledger.com/addressing-the-july-2020-e-commerce-and-marketing-data-breach). At the time, they asserted it consisted "mostly of email addresses, but with a subset including also contact and order details such as first and last name, postal address, email address and phone number." While it is not known whether they obtained it firsthand or secondhand, a hacker has since dumped over one million email addresses and 272,853 shipping orders on [RaidForums](https://archive.is/RdBtk), claiming that the dataset had been selling for 5 BTC. To help customers check whether they were affected by the breach, it was [mirrored](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#Ledger) on [**HaveIBeenPwned**](https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/1340770769106731008).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[**Ledger**](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1340769565639233536) soon tentatively confirmed that this was real customer information. They claimed to have "hired a new Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)," "thoroughly reviewed our data policy," "executed penetration tests and forensic analysis with external security firms," and "are continuously working with law enforcement to prosecute hackers and stop these scammers." In the days that followed, they [shared advice](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1341451918309273600) about what to do, acknowledging that "[some of you are being personally threatened](https://www.ledger.com/blog/6-ways-to-face-the-data-breach)." CEO [Pascal Gauthier](https://twitter.com/_pgauthier/status/1341084660953194497) published [a letter to customers](https://www.ledger.com/message-ledgers-ceo-data-leak/) and spoke on [episode #290](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/ledger-hack-what-happened-with-pascal-gauthier) of [**What Bitcoin Did**](https://twitter.com/WhatBitcoinDid/status/1341347347121328129).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

:warning: If you know or suspect that you were impacted by this breach, I recommend reading Kraken's "[Security Advisory: Mobile Phones](https://blog.kraken.com/post/219/security-advisory-mobile-phones/)," Jameson Lopp's "[A Home Defense Primer](https://blog.keys.casa/a-home-defense-primer/)," and "[A Modest Privacy Protection Proposal](https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/)."

## December 23rd - RELEASE CANDIDATE TESTING

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-11th---bip155-and-tor-onions-v3), I highlighted that Bitcoin Core v0.21 would add support for Tor's v3 hidden service addresses. On December 23rd, the [**Bitcoin Core PR Review Club**](https://twitter.com/BitcoinCorePRs/status/1341159717146677249) hosted [a special edition meeting](https://bitcoincore.reviews/rc-testing) with [Jarol Rodriguez](https://github.com/jarolrod) to organise release candidate testers. The [second release candidate](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2020-November/000094.html) had been published at the end of November. The final version has not been [scheduled](https://bitcoincore.org/en/lifecycle/#schedule) for release yet, though it had previously been [targeted](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18947) for sometime this month.

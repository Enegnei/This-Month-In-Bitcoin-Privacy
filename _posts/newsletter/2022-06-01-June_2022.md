#### May 6th - ZK-ROLLUP RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP UPDATE

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-9th---zk-rollup-research-fellowship), I included the **Human Rights Foundation**'s research fellowship into zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups for Bitcoin. John Light opened a [research library](https://github.com/john-light/zkrollups/blob/main/library.md) "[where I'll be dumping links as I come across interesting resources](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1522691477805096965)." He [shared](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1526722422619131906) an extensive post by developer [Trey Del Bonis](https://tr3y.io/articles/crypto/bitcoin-zk-rollups.html) on the subject:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> While current rollup implementations are very dependent on how Ethereum-style contracts store state and represent settlement, there is no fundamental reason that a UTXO-based ledger cannot support rollups. In this article I aim to explore and sketch out some designs for how a zk rollup might function on a future version of Bitcoin that supports some additional script primitives.
> 
> ... If the rollup involves a small set of parties that make many transactions and for some reason “just using Lightning” isn’t an option, then it may make sense to have an alternate spending path that just takes a signature from all of them and they can all consent to the state transition without having to rely on the chain to enforce the logic. This would be improved by using a taproot output which increases privacy and chain space. Failing that, we could still rely on script to encourage liveness.

#### May 8th - JOINMARKET ADDS ONION-BASED MESSAGING

The latest [v0.9.6](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/releases/tag/v0.9.6) release of [JoinMarket](https://twitter.com/joinmarket) now makes it a requirement to run Tor, because they are replacing their reliance on IRC servers with "quasi-p2p onion-based messaging." [Adam Gibson](https://x0f.org/@waxwing/) wrote a guide on "[how to setup onion message channels in JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/onion-message-channels.md)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The TLDR is that makers serve Tor onions, and after initial rendezvous on "directory nodes", most of the transaction negotiation can happen peer to peer. IRC is still configured and will be for some time. All the message channels are used redundantly.

On May 14th, [v0.6.8](https://github.com/openoms/joininbox/releases/tag/v0.6.8) of [JoinInBox](https://twitter.com/openoms/status/1525391239042015233) ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-21st---introducing-joininbox), [03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-4th---hrf-grants-to-joininbox-zeus-fully-noded), [05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-13th---bip78-payjoin-receiver-in-joinmarket), [10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-9th---joinmarket-privacy-bugfix)) was also released.

#### May 2nd - FINANCIAL CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY 2022

https://fc22.ifca.ai/program.html
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KSF1km9YXU
[TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-3rd---privacy-in-cross-layer-interactions), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-21st---empirical-analysis-of-lightning-privacy)

#### May 6th - ZK-ROLLUP RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP UPDATE

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-9th---zk-rollup-research-fellowship), I included the **Human Rights Foundation**'s research fellowship into zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups for Bitcoin. John Light opened a [research library](https://github.com/john-light/zkrollups/blob/main/library.md) "[where I'll be dumping links as I come across interesting resources](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1522691477805096965)." He [shared](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1526722422619131906) an extensive post by developer [Trey Del Bonis](https://tr3y.io/articles/crypto/bitcoin-zk-rollups.html) on the subject:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> While current rollup implementations are very dependent on how Ethereum-style contracts store state and represent settlement, there is no fundamental reason that a UTXO-based ledger cannot support rollups. In this article I aim to explore and sketch out some designs for how a zk rollup might function on a future version of Bitcoin that supports some additional script primitives.
> 
> ... If the rollup involves a small set of parties that make many transactions and for some reason “just using Lightning” isn’t an option, then it may make sense to have an alternate spending path that just takes a signature from all of them and they can all consent to the state transition without having to rely on the chain to enforce the logic. This would be improved by using a taproot output which increases privacy and chain space. Failing that, we could still rely on script to encourage liveness.

#### May 8th - JOINMARKET ADDS ONION-BASED MESSAGING

The latest [v0.9.6](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/releases/tag/v0.9.6) release of [JoinMarket](https://twitter.com/joinmarket) now makes it a requirement to run Tor, because they are replacing their reliance on IRC servers with "quasi-p2p onion-based messaging." [Adam Gibson](https://x0f.org/@waxwing/) wrote a guide on "[how to setup onion message channels in JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/onion-message-channels.md)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The TLDR is that makers serve Tor onions, and after initial rendezvous on "directory nodes", most of the transaction negotiation can happen peer to peer. IRC is still configured and will be for some time. All the message channels are used redundantly.

On May 14th, [v0.6.8](https://github.com/openoms/joininbox/releases/tag/v0.6.8) of [JoinInBox](https://twitter.com/openoms/status/1525391239042015233) ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-21st---introducing-joininbox), [03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-4th---hrf-grants-to-joininbox-zeus-fully-noded), [05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-13th---bip78-payjoin-receiver-in-joinmarket), [10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-9th---joinmarket-privacy-bugfix)) was also released.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Similarly, on May 29th, the Lightning and onion-based exchange [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) announced that they had "[just implemented the most transparent and easy to audit E2E chat](https://twitter.com/RoboSats/status/1530699837133443072)" based on the [OpenPGP standard](https://www.openpgp.org/).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Every robot avatar has a pair of PGP keys. These are encrypted with your high entropy token, the same token that is double hashed to generate the avatar. Of course, only you know your token! On the chat, every message you send is encrypted for your peer's public key and signed with your private key. Only he can reads them. Same for his messages: only you can read them.
>
> With single click on the 'Export' button you save the PGP credentials and messages (encrypted, decrypted and signature checked). In case of a dispute, your counterpart won't be able to tell a different story to the staff... you can prove otherwise: you have his signed messages!
> 
> The coolest thing is that you can copy or export every PGP key and message into any other OpenPGP tool (GnuPG, OpenKeychain...). And verify for yourself every message if you do not trust the RoboSats client app (Don't trust, verify)

#### May 26th - MINING POOL INTEGRATES PAYNYMS 

The small Vancouver-based Bitcoin mining pool operator [Lincoin Technologies](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.lincoin_technologies_inc.e349b104583a01a876e209cf14618733.html) announced that they had integrated BIP-47 PayNyms ([TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-20th---dirtcoin-diaries-paynym-torch), [06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-30th---introducing-soroban), [09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-15th---new-bip47-draft-and-paynym-torch), [10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-15th---signal-accepts-bitcoin-donations)) for their reward payouts, with the goal of "[setting new standards for the industry](https://twitter.com/LincoinPool/status/1529853127003779072)." In the following days, they published [instructions](https://lincoin.com/how-to-set-up-paynym-bip47-on-your-lincoin-pool-account/) for how to enable them, and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/LincoinPool/status/1531324776072982528) about why PayNyms were superior to static addresses or xPubs ([TMIB03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-27th---what-is-an-xpub):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> 1. Static Address: This is the most insecure method that breaches your privacy. The Spy, by monitoring that address, will know exactly how your performance have been and how much money you have made.
> 
> 2. Xpub: By providing your Xpub to a pool they will be able to generate a new address of your wallet every time they send you a payout. But they will be able to track all your activities across any network (coin) in the past and in the future.
> 
> 3. PayNym: This method is known to fulfill privacy between two parties without giving access to an external party to track them. In this method you provide the pool with a payment code which will be used to generate a new address every time they send you a payout. The pool won't be able to track any other transactions/addresses outside the scope of your relationship and that is why it is considered the best practice.

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-28th---silent-payments), I included [Somsen](https://twitter.com/SomsenRuben/status/1529020377929850882)'s proposal for [Silent Payments](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8). On May 24th, 'w0xlt' [published](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-May/020513.html) a [tutorial](https://gist.github.com/w0xlt/72390ded95dd797594f80baba5d2e6ee) for testing this new scheme on [signet](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/signet/); they have also created [a test library](https://github.com/w0xlt/reusable-taproot-addresses) for the [reusable Taproot addresses](https://gist.github.com/Kixunil/0ddb3a9cdec33342b97431e438252c0a) ([TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#february-22nd---sparrow-wallet-supports-paynyms)). If you would like a breakdown of "the mechanics of Taproot," check out this recent [demonstration](https://blog.bitmex.com/taproot-demonstration/) by [BitMEX Research](https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1539890663847862273).

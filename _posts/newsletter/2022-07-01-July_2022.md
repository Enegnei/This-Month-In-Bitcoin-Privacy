#### May 2nd - FINANCIAL CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY 2022

In [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-3rd---privacy-in-cross-layer-interactions) and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-21st---empirical-analysis-of-lightning-privacy), I highlighted Bitcoin privacy-related research that was featured at last year's Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC21) conference. This year's [FC22 event](https://fc22.ifca.ai/program.html) took place during the first week of May, and once again there were a few papers focused on privacy. István András Seres ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-11th---wabisabi-and-coinpool), [05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-3rd---hackers-congress-paraleln%C3%AD-polis), [07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-3rd---privacy-in-cross-layer-interactions), [10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-13th---quick-and-discreet-lightning-and-dlcs)) co-authored a paper on [Fuzzy Message Detection](https://fc22.ifca.ai/preproceedings/9.pdf) (FMD). Two of the papers in 'Session 6: Mostly Payment Networks' focused on privacy, "[Hide & Seek: Privacy-Preserving Rebalancing on Payment Channel Networks](https://fc22.ifca.ai/preproceedings/152.pdf)" by [Zeta Avarikioti](https://disco.ethz.ch/alumni/ageorgia) et al., and "[Resurrecting Address Clustering in Bitcoin](https://fc22.ifca.ai/preproceedings/87.pdf)" by **Chainalysis** software engineer [Malte Möser](https://maltemoeser.de/) and Princeton associate professor [Arvind Narayanan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/arvindn), in which they "tackle several challenges of change address identification and clustering" and "develop new techniques to predict change outputs with low false positive rates." (It is worth noting that the [latter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KSF1km9YXU) was funded by the Ripple University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), which is known to be [pushing poorly supported anti-Bitcoin 'research'](https://www.quora.com/Is-Ripple-funding-propaganda-against-Bitcoin?share=1), and that event sponsors include platinum-tier **CipherTrace** and gold-tier **Chainalysis**.)
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

#### May 6th - ZK-ROLLUP RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP UPDATE

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-9th---zk-rollup-research-fellowship), I included the **Human Rights Foundation**'s research fellowship into zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups for Bitcoin. John Light opened a [research library](https://github.com/john-light/zkrollups/blob/main/library.md) "[where I'll be dumping links as I come across interesting resources](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1522691477805096965)." He [shared](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1526722422619131906) an extensive post by developer [Trey Del Bonis](https://tr3y.io/articles/crypto/bitcoin-zk-rollups.html) on the subject:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> While current rollup implementations are very dependent on how Ethereum-style contracts store state and represent settlement, there is no fundamental reason that a UTXO-based ledger cannot support rollups. In this article I aim to explore and sketch out some designs for how a zk rollup might function on a future version of Bitcoin that supports some additional script primitives.
> 
> ... If the rollup involves a small set of parties that make many transactions and for some reason “just using Lightning” isn’t an option, then it may make sense to have an alternate spending path that just takes a signature from all of them and they can all consent to the state transition without having to rely on the chain to enforce the logic. This would be improved by using a taproot output which increases privacy and chain space. Failing that, we could still rely on script to encourage liveness.

#### May 8th - JOINMARKET ADDS ONION-BASED MESSAGING

The latest [v0.9.6](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/releases/tag/v0.9.6) release of [JoinMarket](https://twitter.com/joinmarket) now makes it a requirement to run Tor, because they are replacing their reliance on IRC servers with "quasi-p2p onion-based messaging." [Adam Gibson](https://x0f.org/@waxwing/) wrote a guide on "[how to setup onion message channels in JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/onion-message-channels.md)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The TLDR is that makers serve Tor onions, and after initial rendezvous on "directory nodes", most of the transaction negotiation can happen peer to peer. IRC is still configured and will be for some time. All the message channels are used redundantly.

On May 14th, [v0.6.8](https://github.com/openoms/joininbox/releases/tag/v0.6.8) of [JoinInBox](https://twitter.com/openoms/status/1525391239042015233) ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-21st---introducing-joininbox), [03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-4th---hrf-grants-to-joininbox-zeus-fully-noded), [05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-13th---bip78-payjoin-receiver-in-joinmarket), [10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-9th---joinmarket-privacy-bugfix)) was also released.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Similarly, on May 29th, the Lightning and onion-based exchange [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) announced that they had "[just implemented the most transparent and easy to audit E2E chat](https://twitter.com/RoboSats/status/1530699837133443072)" based on the [OpenPGP standard](https://www.openpgp.org/).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Every robot avatar has a pair of PGP keys. These are encrypted with your high entropy token, the same token that is double hashed to generate the avatar. Of course, only you know your token! On the chat, every message you send is encrypted for your peer's public key and signed with your private key. Only he can reads them. Same for his messages: only you can read them.
>
> With single click on the 'Export' button you save the PGP credentials and messages (encrypted, decrypted and signature checked). In case of a dispute, your counterpart won't be able to tell a different story to the staff... you can prove otherwise: you have his signed messages!
> 
> The coolest thing is that you can copy or export every PGP key and message into any other OpenPGP tool (GnuPG, OpenKeychain...). And verify for yourself every message if you do not trust the RoboSats client app (Don't trust, verify)

#### May 12th - PLAID CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT UPDATE

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-1st---class-action-lawsuit-against-plaid-inc) and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-17th---how-private-is-my-pay-app), I covered class action lawsuits and anti-trust complaints against Plaid Inc., a financial technology and identity verification company. The final approval hearing for settlement occurred on May 12th, "[where the Court may hear arguments concerning the approval of the Settlement](https://www.plaidsettlement.com/index.php)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Under the Settlement, Plaid has agreed to minimize the data it stores going forward, to delete certain previously retrieved data, and to improve and maintain certain already-implemented enhancements to Plaid Link. Class Members are also able to view and manage the connections they've made between their financial accounts and chosen applications using Plaid, and delete data stored in Plaid's systems by creating a Plaid Portal account, at my.plaid.com.
>
> In addition, the Settlement establishes a $58 million Settlement Fund, to be used for cash payments to Class Members who submit valid claims for compensation, after deducting the costs of the settlement administration, court-approved attorneys' fees and expenses, and Service Awards for eleven Class Representatives.

#### May 26th - MINING POOL INTEGRATES PAYNYMS 

The small Vancouver-based Bitcoin mining pool operator [Lincoin Technologies](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.lincoin_technologies_inc.e349b104583a01a876e209cf14618733.html) announced that they had integrated BIP-47 PayNyms ([TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-20th---dirtcoin-diaries-paynym-torch), [06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-30th---introducing-soroban), [09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-15th---new-bip47-draft-and-paynym-torch), [10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-15th---signal-accepts-bitcoin-donations)) for their reward payouts, with the goal of "[setting new standards for the industry](https://twitter.com/LincoinPool/status/1529853127003779072)." In the following days, they published [instructions](https://lincoin.com/how-to-set-up-paynym-bip47-on-your-lincoin-pool-account/) for how to enable them, and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/LincoinPool/status/1531324776072982528) about why PayNyms were superior to static addresses or xPubs ([TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-27th---what-is-an-xpub)):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> 1. Static Address: This is the most insecure method that breaches your privacy. The Spy, by monitoring that address, will know exactly how your performance have been and how much money you have made.
> 
> 2. Xpub: By providing your Xpub to a pool they will be able to generate a new address of your wallet every time they send you a payout. But they will be able to track all your activities across any network (coin) in the past and in the future.
> 
> 3. PayNym: This method is known to fulfill privacy between two parties without giving access to an external party to track them. In this method you provide the pool with a payment code which will be used to generate a new address every time they send you a payout. The pool won't be able to track any other transactions/addresses outside the scope of your relationship and that is why it is considered the best practice.

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-28th---silent-payments), I included [Somsen](https://twitter.com/SomsenRuben/status/1529020377929850882)'s proposal for [Silent Payments](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8). On May 24th, 'w0xlt' [published](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-May/020513.html) a [tutorial](https://gist.github.com/w0xlt/72390ded95dd797594f80baba5d2e6ee) for testing this new scheme on [signet](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/signet/); they have also created [a test library](https://github.com/w0xlt/reusable-taproot-addresses) for the [reusable Taproot addresses](https://gist.github.com/Kixunil/0ddb3a9cdec33342b97431e438252c0a) ([TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#february-22nd---sparrow-wallet-supports-paynyms)). If you would like a breakdown of "the mechanics of Taproot," check out this recent [demonstration](https://blog.bitmex.com/taproot-demonstration/) by [BitMEX Research](https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1539890663847862273).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

:information_source: Check out [Seth](https://twitter.com/sethforprivacy/status/1535327935682461698)'s list of "[Bitcoin proposals and ideas to improve privacy that are still a work in progress, were abandoned or never implemented, or failed to make a noticeable impact](https://sethforprivacy.com/posts/proposed-bitcoin-privacy-improvements/)."

## June 2nd - CBDCS IN MAJOR MARKET ECONOMIES

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-27th---chimeras-of-central-bank-digital-currency), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-13th---financial-freedom-and-privacy), [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-4th---the-freedom-of-bitcoin), and [TMIBP17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-9th---a-future-under-central-bank-digital-currency), I have followed exploration, promotion, and criticism of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In the last [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-14th---cbdcs-in-emerging-market-economies), I cited a [research paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf) from the [U.S. Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) on the subject, which has since received [over 1,500 public comments](https://www.federalreserve.gov/cbdc-public-comments.htm). On June 2nd, [Nick Anthony](https://twitter.com/EconWithNick/status/1532425508125913088), a policy analyst for the [**Cato Institute**](https://www.cato.org/people/nicholas-anthony)'s [Center for Monetary & Financial Alternatives](https://www.cato.org/centers/center-monetary-financial-alternatives) (CMFA), reported that "[76% of commenters ... oppose the idea of a CBDC](https://www.cato.org/blog/72-commenters-concerned-about-cbdc)," and showcased a selection of responses concerned with financial privacy.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Out of all the concerns, the American Civil Liberty Union (ACLU) may have taken the most concise stance when [it wrote](https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-and-partners-tell-federal-reserve-digital-cash-anonymity-not-negotiable), “Anonymity is not negotiable when it comes to digital cash.”

On June 22nd, [Congressman Jim Himes](https://himes.house.gov/press-releases?ID=68F8CD52-0825-4902-AFDF-39443C7A1D4D) published [a proposal](https://himes.house.gov/u-s-central-bank-digital-currency) for a Federal Reserve-issued CBDC, with a "critical role in preserving the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency of choice." In the [sections](https://himes.house.gov/_cache/files/3/d/3da9ff6d-4e8a-47b7-be28-ced21ecb5724/2F46398524B2AD91FD40BDC5263F4F23.himes-cbdc-white-paper.pdf) on 'Privacy' and 'Domestic and National Security', Himes asserts that there should be a "careful alignment of expected privacy and anonymity, along with strong financial crime enforcement," especially the Bank Secrecy Act.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> To achieve these goals, the Fed should experiment with a wide range of encryption proofs and privacy solutions that safeguard consumer data and collect only the information necessary to validate transactions. The Fed and other financial regulators should consider testing methods that shield identities and transaction amounts and prevent the aggregation of consumers’ financial history without proper legal justification. The Fed should undertake this consideration with significant public participation, education, and outreach to ensure that consumers and market participants are made aware of testing results and understand how a CBDC is and is not comparable to physical cash. Regulators and Fed officials should examine the possibility of making CBDC test design structures open source to allow academics, computer scientists, and privacy advocates to confirm the software’s efficacy and legitimacy. Congress should implement strict notification requirements so that officials tasked with oversight and civil liberties enforcement are regularly informed of CBDC privacy violations and operational risks.
> 
> .. Security standards and best practices for a U.S. CBDC should be consistent with the goals of the Bank Secrecy Act, particularly with regard to documentation, record‐keeping, employee training, audit cooperation, and internal policies. Because a CBDC should be difficult to use for illegal activities, it will require substantial oversight, done under the auspices of strict confidentiality. Intermediaries must be required to make similar efforts to monitor CBDC funds as is currently required to monitor commercial bank money, such as currency transaction reports and suspicious activity reports.

On June 26th, the [**Bank for International Settlements**](https://www.bis.org/about/areport/index.htm) (BIS) published their [annual report](https://www.bis.org/about/areport/areport2022.pdf) on "the progress we have made to support central banks’ pursuit of monetary and financial stability." It emphasizes that "CBDCs, grounded on trust in the central bank, offer the unique advantages of central bank money to the general public. CBDCs should be based on digital identification, with institutional and technological safeguards to ensure privacy."

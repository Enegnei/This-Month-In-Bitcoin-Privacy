#### March 8th - DARKNET DIARIES

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-29th---ledger-data-breach), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-20th---ledger-data-dump), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-13th---ledger-data-dump-update), and [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-17th---ledger-data-dump-update), I covered a data breach from e-commerce and marketing databases belonging to the Paris-based hardware wallet developer **Ledger**. They have continued to warn their users about [phishing](https://www.ledger.com/phishing-campaigns-status) attempts and how to recognise authentic messages. However, it seems that the effects of the bread are not contained to their service.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

For [episode](https://twitter.com/DarknetDiaries/status/1501226622627811338) [#112](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Snektk5Z2nUzM7DgoEBSx?si=e6a43231d4e44143&nd=1) of the [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) podcast, host [Jack Rhysider](https://twitter.com/jackrhysider) interviewed "a guy named 'Drew' who gives us a rare peek into what some of the young hackers are up to today." About thirty-five minutes into the show, they begin to discuss SIM-swapping attacks ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-16th---blockfi-hires-new-chief-security-officer), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-21st---the-solution-to-sim-swapping), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-8th---sim-swapping-conspiracy-charges)), and 'Drew' confirms that cryptocurrency holders are now one of the most popular targets. As a result, the Ledger databases were particularly valuable because many customers used the same phone number and/or email address for their exchange accounts, including Coinbase. Not only was it easy to check if a given email address had been used with an active account, but "there was an exploit in Coinbase for about one month where you could check the [current] balance of any valid password and username [combination]." So even if the attackers had yet to attempt their swap, they could first narrow down their target list to the most valuable accounts rather than wasting resources compromising empty or low-value ones. Then, because the vast majority of Coinbase users had enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) via text message rather than more secure options, the attackers would carry out SIM swaps on those devices in order to receive the codes too.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> With 2FA enabled on your account, you will have to provide your password (first “factor”) and your 2FA code (second “factor”) when signing in to your account. There are many types of 2FA, ranging from a physical key (such as a YubiKey) — the most secure — to SMS verification — the least secure. Many people choose to use SMS 2FA, because it’s linked to a phone number, rather than to one particular device, and is generally the easiest to set up and to use. Unfortunately, that same level of convenience also makes it easier for persistent attackers to intercept your 2FA codes. We strongly encourage everyone that currently uses SMS as a secondary authentication method to upgrade to stronger methods like Google Authenticator or a security key everywhere it is supported.

In September 2021, the exchange reported that "[between April and early May 2021, the Coinbase security team observed a significant uptick in Coinbase-branded phishing messages](https://blog.coinbase.com/phishing-attacks-are-on-the-rise-here-are-some-steps-you-can-take-to-protect-yourself-872833c7671b)," related to bypassing of their SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA) process, which resulted in [stolen funds from 6,000 customers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-rob-thousands-of-coinbase-customers-using-mfa-flaw/). 'Drew' claimed this flaw was "vital to making your SIM-swap more successful."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On February 15th 2022, **Ledger**'s [year-in-review](https://www.ledger.com/blog-privacy-security-at-ledger-a-year-in-review) included that as per their "public commitment" following the data breach, "we have migrated all order data older than 18 months and will gradually migrate data older than 12, 6 and 3 months in the near future. All this information will be stored in this separate database for 10 years, as per our accounting obligations, and then removed from our system." Shortly thereafter on February 22nd, they also announced that the "[Coinbase Wallet browser extension now supports](https://www.ledger.com/blog-ledger-and-coinbase-join-forces-coinbase-wallet-adds-ledger-support-for-ultimate-security)" their hardware wallet for self-custodial key storage, and released a "co-branded Nano X Coinbase Edition."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

For thefts of ether or ERC-20 tokens, 'Drew' noted that [Tornado Cash](https://tornado.cash/) was often used for mixing. This month, Tornado Cash announced that they would use a "[@chainalysis oracle contract to block OFAC sanctioned addresses from accessing the dapp](https://twitter.com/TornadoCash/status/1514904975037669386)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Rhysider and 'Drew' also cite the Terpin case. In January 2018, [investor and public relations manager](https://transformgroup.com/experts/michael-terpin/) [Michael Terpin](https://twitter.com/michaelterpin) had [lost $23.8 million worth of cryptocurrency](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cryptocurrency-at-t-lawsuit-idUSKBN1L01AA) through [a SIM-swap attack](https://nypost.com/2019/04/13/hackers-are-stealing-millions-in-bitcoin-and-living-like-big-shots/); in May 2019, he won a $75.8 million civil judgment against one co-conspirator, and then went on to sue Nicholas Truglia, "[the mastermind and ringleader](https://nypost.com/2020/05/07/teen-defrauded-cryptocurrency-investor-michael-terpin-out-of-millions-suit-alleges/)," In November 2021, Truglia [pled guilty to criminal charges for conspiracy to commit wire fraud](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/12/ny-man-pleads-guilty-in-20-million-sim-swap-theft/). Terpin commented:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [Nearly four years after my $24 [million] hack, Truglia pleads guilty to wire fraud but prosecutors do not pursue other charges. Ironically, this also takes place on same day as the Biden #FCC finally proposes #SIMswap regulation](https://twitter.com/michaelterpin/status/1471581600102162436).

He was referring to their publication of a [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-376199A1.pdf) that seeks "[to amend the Customer Proprietary Network Information and Local Number Portability rules to prevent subscriber identity module (SIM) swapping scams and port-out fraud](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-rules-prevent-sim-swapping-and-port-out-fraud)."

#### March 11th - U.K. SHUTS DOWN BITCOIN ATMS

In connection with "[an unprecedented package of economic sanctions on Russia and Belarus, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/uk-financial-regulatory-authorities-sanctions-cryptoasset-sector)," the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has [written](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/notice-regulated-firms-exposure-cryptoassets) to "all registered cryptoasset firms and those holding temporary registration status to highlight the application of sanctions on various entities and individuals." On the same day, they have also made a public reminder that [cryptocurrency ATMs are effectively now banned](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/warning-illegal-crypto-atms-operating-uk) in the U.K.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Crypto ATMs offering cryptoasset exchange services in the UK must be registered with us and comply with UK Money Laundering Regulations (MLR). None of the cryptoasset firms registered with us have been approved to offer crypto ATM services, meaning that any of them operating in the UK are doing so illegally and consumers should not be using them.
> 
> ... We are concerned about crypto ATM machines operating in the UK and will therefore be contacting the operators instructing that the machines be shut down or face further action.
>
> Since we published the list of [unregistered crypto firms](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/search?predefined=U) that may have been continuing to conduct business, a recent assessment found that 110 are no longer operational.

In their [list of recommendations](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/uk-financial-regulatory-authorities-sanctions-cryptoasset-sector) for reducing "the risk of sanctions evasion," they urge firms to consider "where blockchain analytics solutions are deployed, ensuring that compliance teams understand how these capabilities can be best used to identify transactions linked to higher risk wallet addresses," and to flag "the use of tools designed to obfuscate the location of the customer (eg an IP address associated with a virtual private network or proxy) or the source of cryptoassets (eg mixers and tumblers)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-2nd---tax-authorities-demand-disclosures), I covered how various tax autohrities, including Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), were seeking to collect personally identifying information, ownership and transaction records from users of cryptocurrency businesses; in [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-26th---a-best-guess-bitbargain-closes), I also covered the closure of a long-time U.K.-based exchange.

## April 28th - EUROPEAN UNION TRILOGUE NEGOTIATIONS

In November 2021, the [European Council](https://twitter.com/EUCouncilPress/status/1463522457478995969) [announced](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/11/24/digital-finance-package-council-reaches-agreement-on-mica-and-dora/) that they had reached agreement "on two proposals that are part of the digital finance package: the ‘Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets' (MiCA) and the ‘Digital Operational Resilience Act' (DORA)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> This agreement forms the Council’s negotiating mandate for trilogue negotiations with the European Parliament.

> ... The purpose of MiCA is to create a regulatory framework for the crypto-assets market that supports innovation and draws on the potential of crypto-assets in a way that preserves financial stability and protects investors.

In December, they further announced their intention to "[update existing rules on information accompanying transfers of funds](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/12/01/anti-money-laundering-council-agrees-its-negotiating-mandate-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/)" to apply to crypto-assets.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The aim of the proposal is to introduce an obligation for crypto-asset service providers to collect and make accessible full information about the sender and beneficiary of the transfers of virtual or crypto assets they operate. This is what payment service providers currently do for wire transfers. The purpose is to ensure traceability of crypto-asset transfers, so as to be able to better identify possible suspicious transactions and if necessary blocking them.

> The modifications introduced by the Council in its position streamline and clarify the Commission’s proposal, in particular by introducing requirements for crypto-asset transfers between crypto-asset service providers and un-hosted wallets. It also requires that the full set of originator information travel with the crypto-asset transfer, regardless of the transaction amount. Given the urgent need to ensure traceability of crypto-asset transfers, the Council in its position aims to synchronise the application of the proposal on transfer of funds and the market in crypto-assets regulation (MiCA).

On March 14th 2022, the European Parliament [announced](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220309IPR25162/cryptocurrencies-in-the-eu-new-rules-to-boost-benefits-and-curb-threats) that the [Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/econ/home/members) (ECON) had "adopted, with 31 votes to 4 and 23 abstentions, its negotiating position on new rules on crypto-assets," and "a decision to enter into negotiations with EU governments on the final shape of the bill was adopted with 33 votes to 25." On March 31st, they further [announced](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26164/crypto-assets-new-rules-to-stop-illicit-flows-in-the-eu) that ECON and "the Committee on Civil Liberties (LIBE) adopted, with 93 votes to 14 and 14 abstentions, their position on draft legislation strengthening EU rules against money laundering and terrorist financing," including the traceability of crypto-assets. They noted that "the rules would not apply to person-to-person transfers conducted without a provider." From here, "the adopted text represents the draft mandate for MEPs to negotiate the final shape of the legislation with EU governments. The EP as a whole should vote on it during the plenary session in April."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

For those unfamiliar with European bureaucracy, trilogues are:

> informal tripartite meetings on legislative proposals between representatives of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Their purpose is to reach a provisional agreement on a text acceptable to both the Council and the Parliament. They may be organised at any stage of the legislative procedure and can lead to what are known as 'first reading','early second reading' or 'second reading' agreements, or to a 'joint text' during conciliation.

They are framed as a way to "[speed up the legislative process while ensuring representativeness and oversight](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2021)690614)." However, the latter aspect of that description seems to be less of a priority. In March 2016, the [European Digital Rights (EDRi) association](https://edri.org/our-work/trilogues-the-system-that-undermines-eu-democracy-and-transparency/) responded to a public investigation by the European Ombudsman into "the transparency of trilogues." They believed, among other risks, that trilogues "profoundly undermine and weaken the position of the only directly democratically-elected institution in the EU, the European Parliament."

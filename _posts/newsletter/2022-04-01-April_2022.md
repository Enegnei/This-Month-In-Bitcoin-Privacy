#### March 8th - DARKNET DIARIES

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-29th---ledger-data-breach), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-20th---ledger-data-dump), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-13th---ledger-data-dump-update), and [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-17th---ledger-data-dump-update), I covered a data breach from e-commerce and marketing databases belonging to the Paris-based hardware wallet developer **Ledger**. They have continued to warn their users about [phishing](https://www.ledger.com/phishing-campaigns-status) attempts and how to recognise authentic messages. However, it seems that the effects of the bread are not contained to their service.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

For [episode](https://twitter.com/DarknetDiaries/status/1501226622627811338) [#112](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Snektk5Z2nUzM7DgoEBSx?si=e6a43231d4e44143&nd=1) of the [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) podcast, host [Jack Rhysider](https://twitter.com/jackrhysider) interviewed "a guy named 'Drew' who gives us a rare peek into what some of the young hackers are up to today." About thirty-five minutes into the show, they begin to discuss SIM-swapping attacks ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-16th---blockfi-hires-new-chief-security-officer), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-21st---the-solution-to-sim-swapping), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-8th---sim-swapping-conspiracy-charges)), and 'Drew' confirms that cryptocurrency holders are now one of the most popular targets. As a result, the Ledger databases were particularly valuable because many customers used the same phone number and/or email address for their exchange accounts, including Coinbase. Not only was it easy to check if a given email address had been used with an active account, but "there was an exploit in Coinbase for about one month where you could check the [current] balance of any valid password and username [combination]." So even if the attackers had yet to attempt their swap, they could first narrow down their target list to the most valuable accounts rather than wasting resources compromising empty or low-value ones. Then, because the vast majority of Coinbase users had enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) via text message rather than more secure options, the attackers would carry out SIM swaps on those devices in order to receive the codes too.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> With 2FA enabled on your account, you will have to provide your password (first “factor”) and your 2FA code (second “factor”) when signing in to your account. There are many types of 2FA, ranging from a physical key (such as a YubiKey) — the most secure — to SMS verification — the least secure. Many people choose to use SMS 2FA, because it’s linked to a phone number, rather than to one particular device, and is generally the easiest to set up and to use. Unfortunately, that same level of convenience also makes it easier for persistent attackers to intercept your 2FA codes. We strongly encourage everyone that currently uses SMS as a secondary authentication method to upgrade to stronger methods like Google Authenticator or a security key everywhere it is supported.

In September 2021, the exchange reported that "[between April and early May 2021, the Coinbase security team observed a significant uptick in Coinbase-branded phishing messages](https://blog.coinbase.com/phishing-attacks-are-on-the-rise-here-are-some-steps-you-can-take-to-protect-yourself-872833c7671b)," related to bypassing of their SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA) process, which resulted in [stolen funds from 6,000 customers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-rob-thousands-of-coinbase-customers-using-mfa-flaw/). 'Drew' claimed this flaw was "vital to making your SIM-swap more successful."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On February 15th 2022, **Ledger**'s [year-in-review](https://www.ledger.com/blog-privacy-security-at-ledger-a-year-in-review) included that as per their "public commitment" following the data breach, "we have migrated all order data older than 18 months and will gradually migrate data older than 12, 6 and 3 months in the near future. All this information will be stored in this separate database for 10 years, as per our accounting obligations, and then removed from our system." Shortly thereafter on February 22nd, they also announced that the "[Coinbase Wallet browser extension now supports](https://www.ledger.com/blog-ledger-and-coinbase-join-forces-coinbase-wallet-adds-ledger-support-for-ultimate-security)" their hardware wallet for self-custodial key storage, and released a "co-branded Nano X Coinbase Edition."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

For thefts of ether or ERC-20 tokens, 'Drew' noted that [Tornado Cash](https://tornado.cash/) was often used for mixing. This month, Tornado Cash announced that they would use a "[@chainalysis oracle contract to block OFAC sanctioned addresses from accessing the dapp](https://twitter.com/TornadoCash/status/1514904975037669386)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Rhysider and 'Drew' also cite the Terpin case. In January 2018, [investor and public relations manager](https://transformgroup.com/experts/michael-terpin/) [Michael Terpin](https://twitter.com/michaelterpin) had [lost $23.8 million worth of cryptocurrency](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cryptocurrency-at-t-lawsuit-idUSKBN1L01AA) through [a SIM-swap attack](https://nypost.com/2019/04/13/hackers-are-stealing-millions-in-bitcoin-and-living-like-big-shots/); in May 2019, he won a $75.8 million civil judgment against one co-conspirator, and then went on to sue Nicholas Truglia, "[the mastermind and ringleader](https://nypost.com/2020/05/07/teen-defrauded-cryptocurrency-investor-michael-terpin-out-of-millions-suit-alleges/)," In November 2021, Truglia [pled guilty to criminal charges for conspiracy to commit wire fraud](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/12/ny-man-pleads-guilty-in-20-million-sim-swap-theft/). Terpin commented:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [Nearly four years after my $24 [million] hack, Truglia pleads guilty to wire fraud but prosecutors do not pursue other charges. Ironically, this also takes place on same day as the Biden #FCC finally proposes #SIMswap regulation](https://twitter.com/michaelterpin/status/1471581600102162436).

He was referring to their publication of a [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-376199A1.pdf) that seeks "[to amend the Customer Proprietary Network Information and Local Number Portability rules to prevent subscriber identity module (SIM) swapping scams and port-out fraud](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-rules-prevent-sim-swapping-and-port-out-fraud)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

#### March 9th - ZK-ROLLUP RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP

The [**Human Rights Foundation**](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1501655418153570305) opened a four-month paid research fellowship to investigate whether zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups could "[help the Bitcoin network with scaling or privacy](https://hrf.org/zkrollups)." ZK-rollups are a second-layer scaling solution that has been proposed for various blockchains, including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) bundle (or "roll-up") hundreds of transfers off-chain and generate a cryptographic proof. These proofs can come in the form of SNARKs (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) or STARKs (scalable transparent argument of knowledge). SNARKs and STARKs are known as validity proofs and get posted to layer 1.
>
> The ZK-rollup smart contract maintains the state of all transfers on layer 2, and this state can only be updated with a validity proof. This means that ZK-rollups only need the validity proof instead of all transaction data. With a ZK-rollup, validating a block is quicker and cheaper because less data is included.

On March 24th, Gladstein [announced](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1507069251047215112) that [John](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1507072351271276551) [Light](https://lightco.in/) had been selected for the position, which would begin in May. "The product of the fellowship will be an industry concept paper that addresses" six questions, including: "How would Bitcoin Core need to change to integrate ZK-rollups? Are there any known current improvement proposals (e.g. OP_CTV) that would help?" `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY` (CTV) is a new opcode central to [Jeremy Rubin](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/339/)'s [BIP-119](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki) soft fork proposal, to support "applications for transaction congestion control and payment channel instantiation, among others." In [July 2021](https://rubin.io/blog/2021/07/02/covenants/), Rubin wrote:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> CTV enables committing to a specific “next” transaction from script. This is the ability to make an unbreakable promise on chain which Bitcoin can enforce (e.g. “This coin can only be spent to my multisig, or my backup after a timelock”). This is a departure from normal script which is traditionally only concerned with restrictions on the sender, CTV imposes restrictions on the recipient. More technically, CTV is essentially the ability to embed a signature of a specific transaction inside of a script without needing any elliptic curve operations. The validation costs are low. For more advanced logic, you can nest multiple different CTV Hashes either using taproot or up to the script length limits in regular script.

On April 22nd, following Rubin's announcement of an upcoming CTV-compatible client release, [BitMEX Research](https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1517563998312570880) wrote a [summary of the proposal and reactions to it](https://blog.bitmex.com/op_ctv-summer-softfork-shenanigans/), which have been mixed. Bob McElrath, who has [co-authored research on Bitcoin convenants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16714) and [vaults](https://btctranscripts.com/misc/2019-02-09-mcelrath-on-chain-defense-in-depth/), responded that the "[new wallet infrastructure is substantial, requiring a new private communication between sender and receiver... NACK from me on this concept](https://twitter.com/BobMcElrath/status/1518240522703454208)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

#### March 11th - U.K. SHUTS DOWN BITCOIN ATMS

In connection with "[an unprecedented package of economic sanctions on Russia and Belarus, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/uk-financial-regulatory-authorities-sanctions-cryptoasset-sector)," the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has [written](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/notice-regulated-firms-exposure-cryptoassets) to "all registered cryptoasset firms and those holding temporary registration status to highlight the application of sanctions on various entities and individuals." On the same day, they have also made a public reminder that [cryptocurrency ATMs are effectively now banned](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/warning-illegal-crypto-atms-operating-uk) in the U.K.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Crypto ATMs offering cryptoasset exchange services in the UK must be registered with us and comply with UK Money Laundering Regulations (MLR). None of the cryptoasset firms registered with us have been approved to offer crypto ATM services, meaning that any of them operating in the UK are doing so illegally and consumers should not be using them.
> 
> ... We are concerned about crypto ATM machines operating in the UK and will therefore be contacting the operators instructing that the machines be shut down or face further action.
>
> Since we published the list of [unregistered crypto firms](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/search?predefined=U) that may have been continuing to conduct business, a recent assessment found that 110 are no longer operational.

In their [list of recommendations](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/uk-financial-regulatory-authorities-sanctions-cryptoasset-sector) for reducing "the risk of sanctions evasion," they urge firms to consider "where blockchain analytics solutions are deployed, ensuring that compliance teams understand how these capabilities can be best used to identify transactions linked to higher risk wallet addresses," and to flag "the use of tools designed to obfuscate the location of the customer (eg an IP address associated with a virtual private network or proxy) or the source of cryptoassets (eg mixers and tumblers)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On March 14th, [Juraj Bednar](https://twitter.com/jurbed/status/1503317788525486081) ([TMIBP15](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2021/#august-17th---atomic-swaps-with-monero-continued)) published a blog post on [how to start a local trading group](https://juraj.bednar.io/en/blog-en/2022/03/14/how-to-create-your-own-crypto-trading-group/) with privacy in mind:

> How do you get members for these groups? Add your acquaintances who are already involved with cryptocurrencies. They don’t have to buy and sell right away. Exchange links, experiences and tips in the discussion group. Group members can invite other members they personally know. In larger cities, this will create several such groups, and some members may be in more than one group. They are thus able to link supply and demand between groups using their reputation (and may even make some money by doing this). It is good if the group also meets in person from time to time. A dinner once a month or some joint crypto event. You will build mutual trust and build interpersonal relationships that will increase the willingness to trade and trust.

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-2nd---tax-authorities-demand-disclosures), I covered how various tax autohrities, including Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), were seeking to collect personally identifying information, ownership and transaction records from users of cryptocurrency businesses; in [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-26th---a-best-guess-bitbargain-closes), I also covered the closure of a long-time U.K.-based exchange.

## April 14th - CBDCS IN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-27th---chimeras-of-central-bank-digital-currency), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-13th---financial-freedom-and-privacy), [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-4th---the-freedom-of-bitcoin), and [TMIBP17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-9th---a-future-under-central-bank-digital-currency), I have followed exploration, promotion, and criticism of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This month, the **Bank for International Settlements** (BIS) published [a volume of papers](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap123.htm) contributed by banks from more than two dozen countries around the world, titled "[CBDCs in emerging market economies](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap123.pdf)." The sections address each country's approach toward data privacy, governance, promoting "central bank objectives," and "the implications of cross-border use."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Several have progressed to the pilot or proof-of-concept stage (eg Hong Kong SAR, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the United Arab Emiratis (UAE)). A few are close to launching (eg China’s eCNY), while some do not see a pressing need for a CBDC in the near future (eg Poland, Singapore).

Below are several interesting excerpts from this 214-page document on the subject of privacy, with clarification additions when needed. In the introductory BIS background paper, the authors state that "CBDC designs can allow for privacy by separating payment services from control over the resulting data."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Such designs could allow anonymity with respect to specific parties, such as PSPs [payments service providers], businesses or public agencies. Like some FPS [fast payment systems], CBDCs could give users control over their payments data, which they need only share with PSPs or third parties as they decide (BIS (2021)). For example, with [the India-based retail FPS] UPI, data ownership and control over their credentials are addressed through application programming interfaces (APIs) that use public key cryptography. For a system that relies on biometric digital ID systems, such as Aadhar in India, the safeguards are even more stringent and crucial. Thus, data and privacy management challenges under CBDCs are not new.

Citing Aadhaar as an example of "data and privacy management" done right does not sit right with me. If you want to know more, check out [Malavika Jayaram](https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/mjayaram)'s talk on "[Biometric ID Cards by the Billion](https://media.ccc.de/v/SHA2017-190-biometric_id_cards_by_the_billion)" (2017) and [Kiran Jonnalagadda](https://twitter.com/jackerhack)'s talk on "[Unpacking the Compromises of Aadhaar, and Other Digital Identities Inspired By It](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10885-unpacking_the_compromises_of_aadhaar_and_other_digital_identities_inspired_by_it)" (2019). Next, in the paper on China’s e-CNY aka "digital renminbi" system, they claim that anonymity will be allowed for "small-value" transactions: 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The e-CNY system follows the principle of “anonymity for small-value and traceability for high-value transactions”, and attaches great importance to protecting personal information and privacy. It aims to meet the public demand for anonymous small-value payment services based on the risk features and information processing logic of current electronic payment systems.

The Czech National Bank (CNB)'s section on "Supporting public privacy" states plainly that "full anonymity is not plausible... Anonymous electronic payments between users are not possible at all."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> However, increasing digitalisation could leave some sections of society behind as potential barriers around trust, digital literacy, access to IT and data privacy concerns create a digital divide. For central banks in many emerging market economies, a key driver for researching CBDC is the opportunity to improve financial inclusion.
>
> Yet for a CBDC to increase financial inclusion, it must address the causes of exclusion, which vary by jurisdiction and are often complex.
>
> ... so a CBDC could only increase privacy partially, but we cannot rule out the possibility that it would not increase it at all (if it created motivation to obtain the data in other ways).

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), like others, believes that privacy can be well protected between users and payment services. In describing their retail central bank digital currency (rCBDC), they say that it is built using a UTXO model (like Bitcoin) and even that "a pseudonym system" could be implemented.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> ... preservation of user privacy vis-à-vis other users and non-client intermediaries could be made possible by a pseudonym system. While the natural transaction traceability of a UTXO model allows intermediaries and users to know who held the rCBDC in the past, such traceability would have privacy implications. To address this issue, the proposed architecture explores the possibility of creating pseudonyms, similar to “nicknames”, to represent the transacting parties during each and every transaction. Only a user’s bank has access to the mapping between the pseudonyms and the user’s real identity, which means that only a user’s bank, not other users or intermediaries, knows the real identity of an rCBDC owner.

The Bank of Israel's answer on their "digital shekel" CBDC warns that the decisions of "major economies" will affect those of "smaller countries," if they don't want to risk being excluded from interoperability. They also suggest that providing more identifying data may be rewarded.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> If, for example, the standard set in the major economies regarding anonymity would require that authorities are able to obtain information regarding a specific transaction if such information is needed for law enforcement, it may not be possible for smaller countries to execute policies that give a greater weight to privacy concerns, if they want their CBDCs to be more similar to cash in this regard.
>
> ... Let us take the example of privacy requirements – any future platform should allow for different privacy levels, even between existing consumers, who may have different requirements regarding privacy. Some may be willing to allow some access to their data in return for, say, lower commissions.

Ten days earlier on April 4th, [**Eurogroup**](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/eurogroup/)'s monthly [meeting](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/eurogroup/2022/04/04/) included "privacy considerations related to a digital euro and how they relate to other policy objectives, such as preventing money laundering, illicit financing and tax evasion." A [presentation](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/profuse/shared/files/dedocs/ecb.dedocs220404.en.pdf?39c27f3bda85972b8070c318bb4e3578) given by the European Central Bank (ECB) notes that 'offline functionality' should allow "full privacy only for close proximity payments that are low-value and low-risk," without revealing what they considered those thresholds to be.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> User anonymity is not a desirable feature, as this would make it impossible to control the amount in circulation and to prevent money laundering.

On April 5th, the European Commission [opened a public industry consultation on the digital euro](https://ec.europa.eu/info/consultations/finance-2022-digital-euro_en#questionnaire), to last until June 14th, on the basis that they soon "[may issue the digital euro in line with its objectives and mandate](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13392-A-digital-euro-for-the-EU_en)." On April 28th, they also opened a "[call for expressions of interest in providing prototypes for digital euro projectpayment solutions](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/profuse/shared/files/dedocs/ecb.dedocs220428.en.pdf?bee92bf1e894a3920421d55fea89b2be)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Almost three months earlier on January 20th, the board of governors for the [U.S. Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) published a 40-page paper "[to foster a broad and transparent public dialogue about CBDCs in general, and about the potential benefits and risks of a U.S. CBDC](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf)." They note that public comment "will be accepted for 120 days and can be submitted here," a deadline of May 20th, though as [**Bitcoin Magazine**](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1501888574412701702) predicts, "[Your opinion means nothing in this decision-making process](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fed-cbdc-vision-is-opposed-to-bitcoin)." They begin by asserting that a U.S. CBDC "would best serve the needs of the United States by being privacy-protected, intermediated, widelytransferable, and identity-verified."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Any CBDC would need to strike anappropriate balance, however, between safeguarding the privacy rights of consumers and affordingthe transparency necessary to deter criminal activity.

Exactly one year ago on April 14th 2021, the ECB had released "[a comprehensive analysis of its public consultation on a digital euro](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2021/html/ecb.pr210414~ca3013c852.en.html)" that ran from October 2020 to January 2021. They had received "over 8,200 responses – a record participation for an ECB public consultation. A large majority of respondents were private citizens (94%)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The analysis confirms, by and large, our initial findings: what the public and professionals want the most from such a digital currency is privacy (43%), followed by security (18%), the ability to pay across the euro area (11%), no additional costs (9%) and offline usability (8%).
> 
> ... Privacy is the most important feature of a digital euro for both the public and professionals, especially merchants and other companies. Both groups support requirements to avoid illicit activities, with fewer than one in ten responses from members of the public showing support for full anonymity.

## April 15th - MORE ART THAN SCIENCE

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-19th---civil-liberties-versus-digital-mercenaries), and [TMIBP16](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2021/#september-16th---coinbase-on-ice), I have reported on Coinbase’s acquisition of Neutrino for blockchain surveillance software and their subsequent contractual relationships with, and data disclosures to, government agencies. This month, the Coinbase Special Investigations Team have published the third and final blog post in a series about what blockchain analysis is. According to a few of their [job openings](https://archive.ph/UQFhd), the Special Investigations Team (emphasis added):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> ... prides itself on being on the front lines of the financial revolution, protecting Coinbase from emerging novel threats. On the Special Investigations team, the data-focused investigator will take on high-risk escalations and proactive research into potential threat actors, particularly those related to the world of NFTs. The role will also include writing queries and scripts to automate future identification. The investigator will help support high risk urgent cases, special projects, and refine and automate new and existing tools.
>
> A defining trait of any successful investigator is inquisitiveness - someone who questions premises and never takes things at face value, while always fact-checking their own intuition. Ideally, the data-focused investigator should be a crypto-forward individual with a drive to see beyond the curve, strong knowledge of various networking protocols, programming languages, and *an artful touch of OSINT expertise*.

In the [first part](https://blog.coinbase.com/part-1-blockchain-analytics-is-more-of-an-art-than-science-d168f9c85761), they show how they would go about attributing an address to an entity or individual, comparing "evidence quality and standard of proof." However, even though they appear to use the language and process of science, they declare that it is "more of an art than science."

> The public nature of blockchains allows for a certain degree of predictive analysis, enabling researchers to associate addresses and transactions with entities and sometimes individuals. Anybody can look at blockchain, but what makes a difference is the accurate **interpretation** of this public data, as well as **corroborating** it with other types of information gathered externally. Once combined such data can be used for **blockchain analytics**.
>
> Blockchain analytics is widely used for market intelligence, trend analysis, and investigations, among many emerging spaces. The main objective of blockchain analytics is **attribution** — linking specific assets and events to particular entities or even individuals.
>
> Attributing ownership, however, is often nuanced because outside observers can only infer it depending on factors such as availability and quality of the evidence. Evidence means proof that indeed an address belongs to an individual or entity. Unless you own an address yourself, it is very difficult to say with absolute certainty who an address is owned by. This is why it’s more fitting to consider **blockchain analytics more of an art than science**.

In the [second part](https://blog.coinbase.com/part-2-blockchain-analytics-is-tricky-at-scale-7b98e763d155), they illustrate "the commonspend," also known as the [common-input-ownership heuristic](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common-input-ownership_heuristic), and point out that a CoinJoin through **Samourai Wallet** or **Wasabi** is "one example of defeating commonspend." They end the post by highlighting the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [list of sanctioned addresses](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20211108) and noting that "our list of blocked addresses is significantly larger. It includes other sanctioned entities as well as designated individuals. We also engage in proactive work to identify sanctioned activity originating from various jurisdictions, including Russia."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In the [third part](https://blog.coinbase.com/part-3-blockchain-heuristics-through-time-b9e5b323bff0), they look at [change address detection](https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Change_address_detection), "more complex and novel blockchain analysis scaling methods, their drawbacks and why time is a critical feature of blockchain analytics." In their first post, they had asserted that "an external observer cannot possibly gain a full picture or claim 100% confidence in attribution," and here they further state that "a conservative approach would dictate not attributing anything that cannot be determined with close to 100% certainty; a liberal approach would allow wider attribution, at the cost of expanding the potential margin of error." At no point do they explain how anyone involved even determines their degree of certainty.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Certainty of attribution is almost scarce and because multiple parties are relying on different tools for conducting transaction tracing on blockchains, it can sometimes yield dramatically different results.

While I do not disagree with their characterisation, it is quite shocking that purveyors of blockchain surveillance would so easily admit that the methods which will inform whether a customer's deposit is refused, or account is closed, or identity flagged and reported to authorities, or accused of being / associating with criminal elements, have such an absence of scientific foundation despite their marketing to the contrary. If only more AML experts would be similarly honest ([TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), [TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#anti-money-laundering-ineffective)). Anything less is certainly not a pretty picture.

## April 28th - EUROPEAN UNION TRILOGUE NEGOTIATIONS

In November 2021, the [European Council](https://twitter.com/EUCouncilPress/status/1463522457478995969) [announced](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/11/24/digital-finance-package-council-reaches-agreement-on-mica-and-dora/) that they had reached agreement "on two proposals that are part of the digital finance package: the ‘Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets' (MiCA) and the ‘Digital Operational Resilience Act' (DORA)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> This agreement forms the Council’s negotiating mandate for trilogue negotiations with the European Parliament.

> ... The purpose of MiCA is to create a regulatory framework for the crypto-assets market that supports innovation and draws on the potential of crypto-assets in a way that preserves financial stability and protects investors.

In December, they further announced their intention to "[update existing rules on information accompanying transfers of funds](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/12/01/anti-money-laundering-council-agrees-its-negotiating-mandate-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/)" to apply to crypto-assets.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The aim of the proposal is to introduce an obligation for crypto-asset service providers to collect and make accessible full information about the sender and beneficiary of the transfers of virtual or crypto assets they operate. This is what payment service providers currently do for wire transfers. The purpose is to ensure traceability of crypto-asset transfers, so as to be able to better identify possible suspicious transactions and if necessary blocking them.

> The modifications introduced by the Council in its position streamline and clarify the Commission’s proposal, in particular by introducing requirements for crypto-asset transfers between crypto-asset service providers and un-hosted wallets. It also requires that the full set of originator information travel with the crypto-asset transfer, regardless of the transaction amount. Given the urgent need to ensure traceability of crypto-asset transfers, the Council in its position aims to synchronise the application of the proposal on transfer of funds and the market in crypto-assets regulation (MiCA).

On March 14th 2022, the European Parliament [announced](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220309IPR25162/cryptocurrencies-in-the-eu-new-rules-to-boost-benefits-and-curb-threats) that the [Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/econ/home/members) (ECON) had "adopted, with 31 votes to 4 and 23 abstentions, its negotiating position on new rules on crypto-assets," and "a decision to enter into negotiations with EU governments on the final shape of the bill was adopted with 33 votes to 25." On March 31st, they further [announced](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26164/crypto-assets-new-rules-to-stop-illicit-flows-in-the-eu) that ECON and "the Committee on Civil Liberties (LIBE) adopted, with [93 votes to 14 and 14 abstentions](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/246612/ECON-LIBE%20Voting%20Session%20-%2031%20March%20(amendments)%20RESULTS.pdf), their position on draft legislation strengthening EU rules against money laundering and terrorist financing," including the traceability of crypto-assets. They noted that "the rules would not apply to person-to-person transfers conducted without a provider." From here, "the adopted text represents the draft mandate for MEPs to negotiate the final shape of the legislation with EU governments. The EP as a whole should vote on it during the plenary session in April."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

For those unfamiliar with European bureaucracy, trilogues are:

> informal tripartite meetings on legislative proposals between representatives of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Their purpose is to reach a provisional agreement on a text acceptable to both the Council and the Parliament. They may be organised at any stage of the legislative procedure and can lead to what are known as 'first reading','early second reading' or 'second reading' agreements, or to a 'joint text' during conciliation.

They are framed as a way to "[speed up the legislative process while ensuring representativeness and oversight](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2021)690614)." However, the latter aspect of that description seems to be less of a priority. In March 2016, the [European Digital Rights (EDRi) association](https://edri.org/our-work/trilogues-the-system-that-undermines-eu-democracy-and-transparency/) responded to a public investigation by the European Ombudsman into "the transparency of trilogues." They believed, among other risks, that trilogues "profoundly undermine and weaken the position of the only directly democratically-elected institution in the EU, the European Parliament."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[Blockchain for Europe](https://twitter.com/BlockchainforEU) (BC4EU), a Brussels-based lobbying union that works to "[develop a European regulatory framework to support and promote blockchain-based innovation](https://www.blockchain4europe.eu/who-we-are/)," wrote that the decision was a "missed opportunity" and "[will lead to insufficient consumer protection, huge privacy concerns](https://www.blockchain4europe.eu/news/ep-vote-on-transfer-of-funds-regulation-threatens-future-of-eu-blockchain-industry/)." The "[final adoption of MiCA](https://www.blockchain4europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blockchain_timeline-May-2022.pdf)" is anticipated to occur in September.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Luckily, the politically-driven mistakes of the European Parliament can be fixed during the trilogue negotiations with the Council of the EU. The latter has taken the right approach when it comes to unhosted wallets. We call on the French Presidency of the Council of the EU to safeguard this approach for the sake of the future of the European economy and the safety of its consumers.

The day before the March 31st vote, [**Ledger**](https://www.ledger.com/blog-why-the-eus-transfer-of-funds-tfr-regulation-is-a-threat-to-financial-freedom) urged their customers to "contact [members of the committees](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/econ/home/members) and urge them to **vote against Compromise D and E of the Transfer of Funds Regulation**." They also challenged the "necessity and proportionality" of these proposals -- as the [**Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society**](http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=150061) had done for AMLD in general ([TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-20th---fatf-public-consultation-closes)) -- and used conclusions from **Chainalysis**. They later published a [27-page document of recommendations for policy makers](https://www.ledger.com/blog-how-can-the-eu-win-web3-ledgers-4-recommendations-for-eu-policy-makers) before the [first trilogue meeting](https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1519609840116527104) on April 28th.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In their recently published [2022 report](https://go.chainalysis.com/rs/503-FAP-074/images/Crypto-Crime-Report-2022.pdf), Chainalysis found that only 0.15% of cryptocurrency transactions in 2021 involved some element of criminality. **Of that, money laundering accounted for just 0.05% of all cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021**. In dollar terms, Chainalysis reports that $8.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency was laundered in 2021. Meanwhile, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime [estimates](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html) that up to $2 trillion – 5% of global GDP – is laundered every year through the traditional financial system in fiat currencies. Moreover, the transparency and immutability of public blockchains equips law enforcement with greater tracking capabilities than they have for fiat currency. **Using these figures, the amount laundered through fiat currency is more than 232 times greater than the amount laundered through crypto**. These facts call into question the fundamental EU principles of [necessity and proportionality](https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/subjects/necessity-proportionality_en).

Patrick Hansen, who has [written about the history and development of MiCA](https://law.stanford.edu/2021/01/12/new-crypto-rules-in-the-eu-gateway-for-mass-adoption-or-excessive-regulation/), "[a recipe for disaster](https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1509543300444868615)." On April 22nd, Hansen was a guest on the '[DeFi Download](https://twitter.com/radixdlt/status/1517550239644897281)' podcast regarding this topic. [Unstoppable Finance](https://medium.com/@unstoppablefinance/unstoppable-finance-statement-on-the-critical-eu-vote-on-defi-wallets-on-thursday-e7abb765edac), a Berlin-based startup where Hansen was head of strategy and growth, warned that "[overall, the [Funds Transfer Regulation (FTR)]’s reporting regime will create massive personal data honeypots, both within private crypto companies & government agencies](https://twitter.com/UnstoppableDeFi/status/1509539556453982218)." **Coinbase** CEO Brian Armstrong's comments from the previous day agreed with this interpretation; he described the legislation as "[anti-innovation, anti-privacy, and anti-law enforcement](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1509202782015819776)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> ... [any time you will receive 1k EUR or more from an “unhosted” wallet, providers like Coinbase would be required to report you & your data to AML authorities. Imagine if your bank had to report you to the authorities for every wire transfer over 1k EUR you receive](https://twitter.com/UnstoppableDeFi/status/1509539554868531208).

These obligations are inspired by guidance from the **Financial Action Task Force** (FATF) on the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Travel Rule ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-20th---how-i-knew-your-customer-fatf-compliance), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-14th---fatf-report-on-red-flag-indicators), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-16th---know-your-customers-customer-kycc), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-19th---fatf-public-consultation-on-virtual-assets), [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-20th---fatf-public-consultation-closes), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-13th---financial-freedom-and-privacy), [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-25th---fatf-delays-finalising-guidance), [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-20th---fatf-report-and-eu-aml-proposals), [TMIBP17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-1st---fatf-travel-rule-updates)). In Hansen's view, "[the EU went beyond what's required](https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1510669633115856897)" and "[clearly has a very strong urge to become the regulatory champion in every tech field out there](https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1510669636689350658)." As I highlighted in [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-20th---fatf-public-consultation-closes), the FATF has no legislative authority in and of itself to require anything.

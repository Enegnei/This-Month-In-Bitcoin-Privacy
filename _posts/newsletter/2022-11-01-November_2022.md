#### September 6th - HRF GRANT TO ROBOSATS

In [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#may-8th---joinmarket-adds-onion-based-messaging), I mentioned a new Lightning and Tor onion-based exchange called [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/). All you need is [a Lightning wallet](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/wallets/) that is compatible with their [escrow process](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/escrow/), and you are ready to trade for/to any [preferred fiat payment method](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/payment-methods/), from gift cards to bank transfers, and even swaps of [on-chain bitcoin](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/swaps/). And in [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-10th---human-rights-foundation-launches-dev-fund), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-4th---hrf-grants-to-joininbox-zeus-fully-noded), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-15th---signal-accepts-bitcoin-donations), [TMIBP16](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2021/#september-14th---hrf-grants-to-chaincase-umbrel-bounty), [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-9th---zk-rollup-research-fellowship), and [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#may-6th---zk-rollup-research-fellowship-update), I have covered grants from the **Human Rights Foundation** (HRF) toward "making the Bitcoin network more private, decentralized, and resilient." On September 6th, chief strategy officer [Alex Gladstein](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1567153396087652354) announced another round of grants, and [RoboSats](https://twitter.com/RoboSats/status/1568680895996993538) "[receive[d] $25,000 to continue development, offer multilingual support and build out guides for the product](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/human-rights-foundation-makes-q3-bitcoin-donations)."

#### September 16th - DIGITAL ASSETS EXECUTIVE ORDER RESPONSES

In March, the Biden administration issued [Executive Order (E.O.) 14067](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/14/2022-05471/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets), "[Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)." U.S. Secretary of State [Antony J. Blinken](https://www.state.gov/biographies/antony-j-blinken/) published [a statement](https://www.state.gov/ensuring-the-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) that "our embassies and missions around the world are ready to partner with the private sector and international bodies to support the development and use of digital asset technology in ways aligned with U.S. values," which supposedly includes "protecting against arbitrary or unlawful surveillance; defending privacy and the exercise of human rights; and supporting financial inclusion." The usual lip service ([TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-14th---cbdcs-in-emerging-market-economies)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> We must support technological advances that promote responsible development and use of digital assets. The technological architecture of different digital assets has substantial implications for privacy, national security, the operational security and resilience of financial systems, climate change, the ability to exercise human rights, and other national goals.

The order required that various secretaries and "heads of other relevant agencies" would "submit to the President a report on the future of money and payment systems" after a certain number of days. To date, the nine reports submitted are:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The Department of Treasury had opened requests for public comment on two topics it was tasked with researching: "[potential opportunities and risks presented by developments and adoption of digital assets](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0861)," and "[the illicit finance and national security risks posed by digital assets](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0961)." The comment periods closed on [August 8th](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/08/2022-14588/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets-request-for-comment) and [November 3rd](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/20/2022-20279/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets-request-for-comment) respectively.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On September 16th, following a [background press call](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/09/16/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-the-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/), the White House published a "[fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)" summarising "frameworks and policy recommendations that advance the six key priorities identified in the EO." *Note: To the staff who wrote this sheet -- would it have killed you to actually cite these "nine reports submitted to the President" somewhere? :confounded: I had to go search for them all separately across different agency websites, with the bureaucratese of the [original order](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/14/2022-05471/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets) as my only guide.*
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[Garland](https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland)'s report was written in collaboration with "the Department of Justice’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET)," which was formed almost one year ago ([TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#february-17th---justice-departments-ncet-director)). The report also "serves as an update to the Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework" issued under former Attorney General William "Bill" Barr ([TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> It proposes actions designed to enhance law enforcement’s ability to gather evidence and prosecute crimes; strengthen certain laws and penalty provisions that play an important role in digital asset prosecutions; support proposed regulations that would enhance customer-identification efforts and other anti-money-laundering requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act; and ensure that law enforcement and regulatory agencies have adequate resources to conduct the technologically sophisticated investigations inherent in the digital assets space.

Under a sub-section on 'Decentralized Finance (DeFi),' they note that "enforcing applicable statutory and regulatory obligations can be challenging," and "several DeFi projects have affirmatively touted the lack of money laundering controls as one of the primary goals of decentralization," citing **ShapeShift** ([TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-6th---shapeshifting-back)) and Tornado Cash ([TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-8th---darknet-diaries), [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#august-8th---ofac-sanctions-tornado-cash)) as examples.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

After a lengthy third section that exhibits key "U.S. regulatory agencies," their respective roles, and notable cases, the fourth section lists "several legislative and regulatory actions that, in the Department’s view, would facilitate efforts to investigate, prosecute, and otherwise disrupt digital asssets-related criminal activity." This includes "extending the statute of limitations for crimes involving digital assets from five years to ten," and "strengthening of the Sentencing Guidelines applicable to certain BSA violations," such as "tying the base offense level to the amount of funds involved." Regarding the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)'s rulemaking on the collection of personal and financial information of cryptocurrency users (see [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-20th---fincen-proposed-rulemaking-suspended), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-1st---fincen-proposed-rulemaking-update)), the Justice Department intends to "support FinCEN in enforcing the rule and encouraging its implementation throughout the digital assets industry."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Under the final sub-section 'Proposal to Ensure Adequate Funding of Law Enforcement Operations,' the report urges that "the President’s budget should seek funding from Congress for additional tools and technical resources specific to digital assets that can support investigations and search-and-seizure operations, including blockchain analytical tools and the technical infrastructure (e.g., server space or cloud access) needed to ingest and maintain potentially voluminous and complex data and to analyze that data."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Cato Institute** [Center for Monetary & Financial Alternatives](https://www.cato.org/centers/center-monetary-financial-alternatives) (CMFA) policy analysts [Nicholas Anthony](https://www.cato.org/people/nicholas-anthony) and [Jack Solowey](https://www.cato.org/people/jack-solowey) published their initial review on several aspects of the framework, including insights about underlying interagency conflicts. "[When the market is supplying the innovation, the Administration — and Congress — have a responsibility to do no harm](https://www.cato.org/blog/white-houses-statement-cryptocurrency)." On September 19th, Anthony began a five-part series breaking down the reports by the Departments of [Justice](https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-cryptocurrency-reports-part-2-role-law-enforcement-detecting-investigating-prosecuting) and [Commerce](https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-cryptocurrency-reports-part-4-responsible-advancement-us-competitiveness-digital-assets), and [three](https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-cryptocurrency-reports-part-1-action-plan-address-illicit-financing-risks-digital-assets) [from](https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-cryptocurrency-reports-part-3-implications-consumers-investors-businesses) [Treasury](https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-cryptocurrency-reports-part-5-future-money-payments).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> To monitor risks, the Treasury called for the expansion of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) in addition to what is already in the third recommendation. Considering that the BSA [**has been expanded legislatively**](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/revising-bank-secrecy-act-protect-privacy-deter-criminals) through several acts over the years and [**has been expanded practically**](https://www.cato.org/blog/how-inflation-erodes-financial-privacy) through inflation since 1972, further expansions are not warranted until the government can prove how effective the BSA has been. And if [**what evidence that is already available**](https://www.cato.org/blog/how-inflation-erodes-financial-privacy) is any indication, the BSA should be limited or repealed, not expanded.

I have previously included the CMFA's research on financial privacy and surveillance in [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-19th---civil-liberties-versus-digital-mercenaries), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-13th---financial-freedom-and-privacy), and [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-2nd---cbdcs-in-major-market-economies). On October 18th, vice president [Norbert Michel](https://twitter.com/norbertjmichel) and [Jennifer J. Schulp](https://twitter.com/jenniferjschulp) [released](https://twitter.com/CatoInstitute/status/1582382697824993284) "[Restoring Financial Privacy](https://www.cato.org/study/restoring-financial-privacy)," a dynamic study of the BSA's history and impact. Backing up Anthony's claim that it has been "expanded practically," they again pointed out that if the original $10,000 reporting threshold for financial institutions had been adjusted for inflation, it would be "[nearly $75,000 today](https://twitter.com/CatoCMFA/status/1581982898047291394)." On October 27th, [Anthony](https://twitter.com/EconWithNick/status/1586748765658120194) also wrote for the [American Institute for Economic Research](https://www.aier.org/article/fincen-and-fed-proposal-means-less-privacy-more-exclusion/) (AIER) about these reports, and the ineffectiveness of FinCEN:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Despite [FinCEN] Acting Director Das’s claim that the program is effective, it appears to have high costs with little or no benefits. The current regime is estimated to have cost US businesses [$26.4 billion](https://risk.lexisnexis.com/insights-resources/research/2019-true-cost-of-aml-compliance-study-for-united-states-and-canada) in 2019. And while FinCEN has not reported any numbers regarding how many criminals the regime stopped, FinCEN has shared that it received [20 million reports in 2019](https://www.fincen.gov/what-bsa-data). Separately, the [Bank Policy Institute](https://bpi.com/getting-to-effectiveness-report-on-u-s-financial-institution-resources-devoted-to-bsa-aml-sanctions-compliance/) found in 2018 that law enforcement only followed up with banks on 3.85 percent of suspicious activity reports (SARs) and 0.44 percent of currency transaction reports (CTRs). Moreover, [Norbert Michel and David Burton](https://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/report/financial-privacy-free-society) found in 2016 that money-laundering investigations by the FBI had fallen between 2001 and 2011, despite the number of suspicious activity reports rising significantly.
>
> The issue isn’t just one of government waste, though. As the government gathers more data, there continues to be a greater risk that it will use the data. For example, as noted by [Lawrence White](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/spring/summer-2018/curse-war-cash#require-new-reports-on-cross-border-currency-transactions-for-financial-institutions), “Innocent family businesses have been charged with structuring, and had tens of thousands of dollars seized by the federal government, merely for making repeated deposits or withdrawals below the $10,000 [CTR] threshold.” Moreover, Operation Chokepoint, Canada’s [freeze on protestors’ bank accounts](https://www.cato.org/working-paper/crafting-better-framework-financial-privacy-digital-age), and ICE’s recent collection of money-transfer data all showcase how this data is being used to target citizens.

#### September 21st - TREZOR ADDS COIN CONTROL

In [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-9th---trezor-to-add-coinjoin-and-coin-control), I reported that hardware wallet company **Trezor** had plans to support [CoinJoin](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/issues/2745) and [coin control](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/issues/2770) features in their Suite interface. While the CoinJoin part remains in limbo (apparently delayed until at least next year, due to external issues with the implementation of WabiSabi), they finally announced that [version 22.9.3](https://blog.trezor.io/coin-control-in-trezor-suite-92f3455fd706) adds manual coin/ transaction output selection.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Coin control is an advanced feature that allows you to specify which UTXOs you want to spend in a transaction. Used properly, it can improve privacy, though we only recommend that you use it once you are familiar with the principles.
> 
> ... When making a payment, your wallet may need to spend the contents of several UTXOs to make up the total purchase amount. Without Coin control, **your wallet automatically chooses** which to spend, favoring the cheapest option.
>
> Each of those UTXOs has its own lineage of previous transactions, some of which may offer hints that reveal information about you that you don’t want to share. **To protect your privacy**, you can enable Coin control and specify which particular UTXOs to use in a transaction.

In [November](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1590374260476112899), in collaboration with the peer-to-peer exchange [**Hodl Hodl**](https://twitter.com/hodlhodl/status/1590343563648602113), they also introduced the option to [buy bitcoin](https://trezor.io/learn/a/p2p-with-trezor) from within the Suite, no KYC verification required. Amidst news of [the FTX scandal](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/unpacking-the-ftx-fraud), [**Trezor**](https://blog.trezor.io/bitcoin-without-middlemen-8a76e6073ad8) warned:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Leaving bitcoin on an exchange increases their power and influence. In crypto, many of the tokens that end up collapsing are under the sphere of influence of exchanges, tied to risk-hungry investment firms.
>
> The disrepute brought to Bitcoin by association has repeatedly held back progress and threatened the Bitcoin ecosystem. By giving custody of bitcoin to a major exchange, the majority of people who believe they own bitcoin are in fact centralizing power in the hands of a few entities.
>
> The saying “rules, not rulers” is also often applied to Bitcoin. The golden rule is that whoever controls the keys, controls the Bitcoin. The sooner the broader community learns to take control, the sooner Bitcoin will be decoupled from the influence of playboy economics.

#### September 26th - UNREDACTED MAGAZINE

In April, Michael Bazzell, author of "[Extreme Privacy: What It Takes to Disappear](https://inteltechniques.com/book7.html)," "[Open Source Intelligence Techniques: Resources for Searching and Analyzing Online Information](https://inteltechniques.com/book1.html)," and host of the weekly "[Privacy, Security and OSINT Show](https://www.inteltechniques.com/podcast.html)," had [announced the launch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/258-introducing-unredacted-magazine/id1165843330?i=1000558380784) of [a new independently published magazine](https://unredactedmagazine.com/) focused around the same topics, and inspired by the style of [*2600: The Hacker Quarterly*](https://2600.com/). This month, he [published](https://twitter.com/IntelTechniques/status/1574397289791074304) the fourth issue of [**Unredacted**](https://unredactedmagazine.com/issues/004.pdf), which includes two pieces about Bitcoin privacy: "Bitcoin Privacy Tools & Tactics" and "Tracking Bitcoin: Tools for OSINT" by analyst 'Ergo' (see [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-18th---dust-attacks), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-21st---financial-cancel-culture), and [TMIBP15](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2021/#august-4th---understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt)). The first article outlines "basic building blocks to thwarting effective bitcoin tracking," and the second advertises the features of **Samourai Wallet**'s [OXT](https://oxt.me/) blockchain analysis tool ([TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#february-19th---samourai-bitcoin-privacy-series)) to "OSINT practitioners" interested in "incorporat[ing] bitcoin tracking and information into their investigations."

#### September 30th - EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY ON PRIVACY WALLETS

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-28th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations), I included that the [European Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/12/01/anti-money-laundering-council-agrees-its-negotiating-mandate-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/) had announced "a mandate to negotiate with the European Parliament on a proposal to update existing rules on information accompanying transfers of funds," also known as the 'Funds Transfer Regulation (FTR) / Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR),' with the intent to "extend the scope of the rules to certain crypto-assets" in a way that was 'synchronised' with the ‘Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets' (MiCA). In [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-30th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations-update), I summarised key points of the [provisional agreement](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/29/anti-money-laundering-provisional-agreement-reached-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/) reached in the trilogue negotiations.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

According to [a draft](https://blockworks.co/news/leaked-eu-docs-warn-members-to-clamp-down-on-crypto-mixers) obtained by [**Blockworks**](https://twitter.com/Blockworks_/status/1577380069626023964) [editor and journalist](https://blockworks.co/author/david-canellis) [David Canellis](https://twitter.com/dcanellis/status/1577564040263516160), the amendments to the [FTR/TFR](https://www.eumonitor.eu/9353000/1/j4nvk6yhcbpeywk_j9vvik7m1c3gyxp/vjuo7ak2n0zf) [2015/847](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015R0847) focus on the requirements of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), which include "[any person whose occupation or business is the provision of one or more crypto-asset services to third parties on a professional basis](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593)" (see [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-20th---fatf-report-and-eu-aml-proposals)). They also state that the [European Banking Authority](https://www.eba.europa.eu/about-us/eba-at-a-glance) (EBA):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> shall clarify, in particular, how the risk factors listed in Annex III shall be taken into account by crypto-asset service providers including when performing transactions with persons and entities which are not covered by this Directive. To that end, the EBA shall pay particular attention to products, transactions and technologies that may favor anonymity such as privacy wallets, mixers or tumblers.

> Where situations of higher risk are identified, the guidelines shall include enhanced due diligence measures that obliged entities shall consider applying to mitigate such risks, including the adoption of appropriate procedures to detect the origin or destination of crypto-assets.

The guidance published by the [**Financial Action Task Force**](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html) (FATF) last year lists "[the use of anonymizing techniques for VA funds transfers (e.g., AECs, mixing and tumbling services, the clustering of wallet addresses, privacy wallets)](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf)" as an element for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) -- a category of 'obliged entities' essentially equivalent to CASPs -- to consider in their AML/CFT risk assessment ([TMIBP17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-1st---fatf-travel-rule-updates)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Blockchain analytics are also widely used by VASPs and some FIs to monitor their own exposure to risk (e.g., VA transfers that have passed through mixer servicesor come from privacy wallets). It is important to consider any potential implications for privacy and data protection in the use of such tools, if they allow transparency that is not otherwise available (e.g., on public blockchains).

On October 21st, the [EBA](https://twitter.com/EBA_News/status/1584558559932866561) "[issued a call for expression of interest](https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-launches-call-interest-two-expert-groups-and-call-input-advise-its-work-under-recast-funds)" in joining a 'Technical Expert Group' (TEG) that would "provide expertise on the financial crime risks to which CASPs are exposed and challenges that market participants may face when implementing the revised TFR." The deadline for submission of responses was November 15th.

On November 15th, [**CoinDesk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1592478584135995392) regulatory reporter [Jack Schickler](https://twitter.com/jackschickler), who was [formerly](https://be.linkedin.com/in/jack-schickler) "[a speechwriter and policy analyst at the European Commission](https://www.coindesk.com/author/jschickler/)" and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), wrote about "[a leaked draft of a money laundering bill](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/15/privacy-enhancing-crypto-coins-could-be-banned-under-leaked-eu-plans/)." To be clear, like MiCA, it does not appear that this draft bill would ban the use of privacy coins by private individuals:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

#### October 8th - MY BITCOIN PRIVACY ANNIVERSARY

People often ask, "How did you become interested in [Bitcoin] privacy?" Well, seven years ago on this day, I attended my first ever [Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/coinscrum/status/651779064764760064) [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/coinscrum/events/225895988/) at University College London (UCL). I had already been conscious of Bitcoin for two years, but in comparison to my work today, I basically knew nothing and no one. The topic of the meetup was -- coincidentally -- a paper about coin mixing, "[CoinParty: Secure Multi-Party Mixing of Bitcoins](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1145/2699026.2699100)" by then communication and distributed systems PhD [Jan Henrik Ziegeldorf](https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/team/jan-henrik-ziegeldorf/) et al. from [*Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule* (RWTH) *Aachen*](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1). I understood almost nothing that was said, except this was a proposed method to improve Bitcoin's privacy. While I already deeply cared about personal privacy, if you had told me this would soon become a central professional focus of mine, I don't think I would have believed you!

#### October 10th - SAVE THE ONION ROUTER CAMPAIGN

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-11th---bip155-and-tor-onions-v3), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-23rd---release-candidate-testing), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-14th---bitcoin-core-v021-released), and [TMIBP16](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2021/#september-19th---bisq-transitions-to-tor-v3) I have followed the Tor v3 transition and the importance of [network privacy](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/tags/#network-privacy). Since June, the [Tor](https://status.torproject.org/) [network](https://metrics.torproject.org/torperf.html) has been under a [distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) atack](https://status.torproject.org/issues/2022-06-09-network-ddos/) that remains unresolved ([TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#july-12th---beta-launch-of-tunnel-sats)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Until we are able to determine mechanisms for rate limiting this activity, through development, experimentation, and testing, this DoS activity will continue to cause performance and reliability problems on the network. For details, see a [recent thread](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2022-October/020858.html) on our tor-relays mailing list.

This month, [Riccardo Masutti](https://twitter.com/RiccardoMasutti/status/1579530120288927750) ([TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-5th---payjoin-support-in-wasabi-and-joinmarket), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-3rd---hackers-congress-paraleln%C3%AD-polis), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-10th---tor-consensus-issue), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-1st---disjointed-services-flagging-mixed-coins), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-22nd---pizza-wasabi-and-privacy---oh-my)) launched a "[Save The Onion Router](https://savetor.network/)" (STOR) crowdfunding "[campaign to configure and manage new guard/middle relays](https://twitter.com/RiccardoMasutti/status/1579530149187706880)." On November 16th, he shared [a technical guide for managing multiple relays](https://github.com/RiccardoMasutti/STOR). According to the site's counter, over $10,000 has been raised so far, in addition to "a big private donation that will be sent directly to" the **Tor Project**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-10th---nym-mixnet-test-rewards-in-bitcoin) and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-10th---state-of-the-onion-and-nym), I highlighted that the **Tor Project** was considering "a token-based approach" for "prioritiz[ing] good clients over malicious clients when a denial of service attack is happening." On November 15th, Adam Gibson gave his thoughts on this during his [talk](https://pretalx.com/adopting-bitcoin-2022/talk/RVFS9C/), "[Identity Is The Problem](https://youtu.be/5ckIrGXLTa0)," at the [Adopting Bitcoin](https://adoptingbitcoin.org/2022/) conference in El Salvador. He then outlined his RIDDLE proposal ([TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-10th---riddle-me-this)):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> RIDDLEs let nodes buy Chaumian tokens (CTs) anonymously from peer nodes to allow routing to work. In baseline operation, the cost in CTs per routing attempt is very low. Ordinary user won’t see a cost worth mentioning. Rep[utation] tokens could also be spent as an ’optimistic mode’ thing. If traffic starts to get higher, start to ramp up the CTs per routing attempt cost. For a user who just wants to do one payment, they should still be fine but an attacker sending a stream is going to use up a lot of resources.

#### October 11th - ZK-ROLLUP RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP UPDATE

> Given the large amount of excitement and investment going into rollup technology, and given the alignment of trustless validity rollups with the trustless ethos of bitcoin, one might wonder: are validity rollups a good fit for bitcoin, too? To answer this question, we must first take a step back and answer the more foundational questions: Is it even technically possible to build validity rollups on bitcoin? And if it is technically possible to build validity rollups on bitcoin, what would be the benefits, costs, and risks associated with doing so?[<sup>51</sup>](https://hrf.org/zkrollups)

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-9th---zk-rollup-research-fellowship) and [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#may-6th---zk-rollup-research-fellowship-update), I followed John Light's [research fellowship](https://github.com/john-light/zkrollups/blob/main/library.md) into zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups for Bitcoin. This month, he [published](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1579856946781298688) his [extensive final report](https://bitcoinrollups.org/), with over 20,000 words and almost two hundred citations:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Regarding terminology: these protocols are often called "zk-rollups." This can be a misnomer, since not all protocols called "zk-rollups" use "zero knowledge" proofs. But they do all use validity proofs! So for the report I used the more accurate term "validity rollup."

He first outlines the history of both zero-knowledge proofs and, more recently, blockchain scaling solutions, particularly off-chain transaction execution protocols like payment channels on the Lightning Network. Next, he proceeds to define validity rollups, their variants, how they function in practice, and what has been learned from existing implementations, such as [shielded transaction rollups on Ethereum](https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztecs-zk-zk-rollup-looking-behind-the-cryptocurtain-2b8af1fca619).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In the years since Satoshi Nakamoto first contemplated how zk proofs could be used to improve bitcoin privacy, cryptographers have invented new protocols that greatly improve the quality and usability of private cryptocurrency transactions. Validity rollups make it possible to implement these new privacy protocols on bitcoin while inheriting the full ownership security of BTC owned on L1. This would provide bitcoin users with state-of-the-art privacy without having to give up self-custody of their BTC. Additionally, with a flexible enough proof verification system implemented in the bitcoin consensus rules, bitcoin can be future-proofed so that new advancements in privacy protocols can be adopted without requiring any further consensus-level changes to bitcoin.
> 
> ... Despite the popularity of using Turing-complete programming languages to build rollup smart contracts, it would be possible to build a validity rollup on bitcoin using bitcoin’s native Turing-incomplete programming language, Script, with relatively small changes (in terms of code footprint) to the opcodes Script supports.

The final sections explore the (mostly technical) costs and risks in terms of bandwidth, data storage, verification, miner extractable value (MEV) and algorithmic incentive manipulation (AIM) attacks, vulnerabilities in the cryptographic proof system that allow for supply inflation, and lastly "the possibility of provoking a crackdown on bitcoin by authoritarian governments who may be opposed to the strong privacy and censorship-resistant applications these protocols enable."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Discussion about the potential of validity rollups for Bitcoin continued on the [developer mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/020998.html) with [Greg Sanders](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021004.html), [Adam Gibson](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021153.html), [Trey Del Bonis](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021164.html), [Russell O'Connor](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021165.html), and '[ZmnSCPxj](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021166.html).'

#### October 15th - SILENT PAYMENTS, CONTINUED

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-28th---silent-payments) and [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#may-26th---mining-pool-integrates-paynyms), I noted Ruben Somsen's '[Silent Payments](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8)' proposal, "[a new scheme for private non-interactive address generation without [extra] on-chain overhead](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-March/020180.html)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Since then, [Somsen](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-June/020549.html) and others discussed both Silent Payments and ways to [improve BIP-47](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/21c477c90c942acf45f8e8f5c1ad4fae) during the [Pizza Day](https://youtu.be/VWXgp-59glg) celebrations at Paralelní Polis. The [second](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-August/020857.html) [version](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-August/020883.html) of the implementation by 'w0xlt' was released in August. With [the](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020953.html) [third](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020955.html) [version](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/020971.html) in September, Somsen also wrote about ways "[the sender can be sure that the address it receives from the server belongs to the recipient](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020952.html)" when a third-party server is involved, whether with BIP-47 PayNyms or Silent Payments. On October 11th, with the [fourth version](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/020994.html)'s release, "Silent Payments now use all inputs to create transactions. Previously, they only used the first input. This change increases privacy and makes Silent Payments compatible with Coinjoin."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On October 1st, [**Samourai Wallet**](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1576222429441314817) reiterated that the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process has become a "sham," and "should be reserved solely for consensus critical proposals." Despite still being labeled as "unanimously discourage[d] for implementation," [BIP-47](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) PayNyms have been adopted by two wallets ([TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#february-22nd---sparrow-wallet-supports-paynyms), a [mining pool operator](https://twitter.com/LincoinPool/status/1579488015059419137) ([TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#may-26th---mining-pool-integrates-paynyms)), and a non-profit for receiving charitable donations ([TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-15th---signal-accepts-bitcoin-donations)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> If Silent Payments has legs to stand on, someone will implement it, and it can compete in the market with PayNym and in that scenario, users win.

On October 15th, [Somsen](https://twitter.com/SomsenRuben/status/1581132746239676416) delivered a mainstage talk, "Silent Payments and Alternatives," for [the last day](https://2022.tabconf.com/2022-schedule/) of [The Atlanta Bitcoin Conference](https://2022.tabconf.com/) ([TABConf](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsTEmnKYqfGNc5sZrxYXRrw/videos)). He outlined the various non- or semi-interactive constructs for paying people, and how they compared from a privacy and scaling perspective. [Bryan Bishop](https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1581332400344219648) later published a rough [transcript](https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/tabconf/2022/silent-payments/).

## November 1st - RASPIBLITZ AND JAM

> The name "Jam" is a backronym, stands for [*JoinMarket's Awesome, Man*](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/jam/issues/22#issuecomment-1024654436), and shouldn't be taken too seriously. However, it works on multiple levels (*Let's jam the signal!*) and "cooking jam" is also a fun metaphor for mixing something in a tasty way (and putting it in [jars](https://jamdocs.org/glossary/)).

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-21st---introducing-joininbox), [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-4th---hrf-grants-to-joininbox-zeus-fully-noded), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-13th---bip78-payjoin-receiver-in-joinmarket), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-9th---joinmarket-privacy-bugfix), and [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#may-8th---joinmarket-adds-onion-based-messaging), I've followed the building of one "fungibility toolchest" with the integration of [JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver) into **RaspiBlitz**, "[a do-it-yourself Lightning Node based on LND](https://shop.fulmo.org/raspiblitz/)."

'[Openoms](https://twitter.com/openoms/status/1579773400436068353)' noted that RaspiBlitz had a pending [pull-request](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/pull/3321) with "the latest versions on Jam, JoinMarket and Joininbox with a one-click install," and encouraged people to run tests. [Jam](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/jam) had [already been merged](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/2891) into the [v1.7.2](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/releases/tag/v1.7.2) release back in February, shortly after Jam's "[first 'public' version](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/jam/releases/tag/v0.0.3)" release, but was not yet displayed in the main menu. On November 1st, the pull-request was merged toward the upcoming [v1.9.0](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/milestone/16) release.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

You can install Jam on [RaspiBlitz](https://raspiblitz.org/), [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com/), or [Citadel](https://runcitadel.space/) by following these [instructions](https://jamdocs.org/software/installation/).

## November 2nd - FINMA LOWERS KYC THRESHOLD AGAIN

The **Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority** (FINMA) has confirmed its decision to lower the threshold for KYC-lite or KYC-less purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In January 2021, they had already lowered the daily "[client identification threshold values from CHF 5,000 to CHF 1,000](https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2020/11/20201112-medienmitteilung-folgeregulierung-fidleg-finig/)." In March of this year, their Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance was tightened even further, and "[now states that the threshold of CHF 1000 applies for linked transactions within thirty days (and not per day)](https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2022/03/20220308-mm-anhoerung-gwv-finma/)." In May, during the public consultation period, the Swiss-based [**Pocket** app](https://pocketbitcoin.com/blog/posts/finma-wants-to-lower-limits-further#action) submitted comments that they "consider the proposed change highly discriminatory and disproportionate," and encouraged other people to send letters.

> [DE] Zahlreiche Anhörungsteilnehmende haben.. geltend gemacht, dass mit der Einschränkung des Schwellenwertes auf 30 Tage die Technologieneutralität, die Privatsphäre sowie das Verhältnismässigkeitsprinzip verletzt würden. Ferner existiere für den Geldwechsel mit Fiat Währungen keine solche Einschränkungund das Regulierungsvorhaben beruhe nicht auf genügend recherchierten Fakten.
> 
> [EN] Numerous participants in the consultation.. argued that the restriction of the threshold to 30 days would violate technological neutrality, privacy and the principle of proportionality. Furthermore, no such restriction exists for fiat currency exchanges and the proposed regulation is not based on sufficiently researched facts.

On November 2nd, after [reviewing comments](https://finma.ch/en/~/media/finma/dokumente/dokumentencenter/anhoerungen/laufende-anhoerungen/20221102-gwv-finma/ab_gwv_finma_20221027_de.pdf) received up until June 10th, FINMA announced that they [remain firm on that decision](https://finma.ch/en/news/2022/11/20221102-mm-gwv-finma/):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> FINMA received numerous responses concerning the specification of the threshold for transactions with virtual currencies. In view of the risks and recent instances of abuse, FINMA stands by the rule that technical measures are needed to prevent the threshold of CHF 1000 from being exceeded for linked transactions within thirty days (and not just per day). However, this duty only applies to exchange transactions of virtual currencies for cash or other anonymous means of payment.

This corresponds with crackdowns on [ATMs](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/easy-guide-to-bitcoin-atms) in other European countries, to align with the FATF's guidance ([TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-14th---fatf-report-on-red-flag-indicators), [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-11th---uk-shuts-down-bitcoin-atms)).

## November 8th - QUANTITATIVE MEASURING OF FUNGIBILITY

> Intuitively, by fungibility, we think of measuring the uncertainty any observer of the public ledger has about the origins of coins residing at a specific address. On the other hand, anonymity measures the uncertainty of a possibly more potent adversary about the source of some coins. In particular, when measuring anonymity, we allow the adversary to have external knowledge or additional heuristics about the flow of cryptocurrency. This external knowledge might come from the peer-to-peer (P2P) layer or any source other than the public ledger. Therefore, we treat anonymity as a subjective measure of an adversary’s uncertainty, while fungibility is the measure of the maximum uncertainty given only the public ledger as an information source.
> 
> ... Privacy and fungibility are closely linked, as reduced fungibility can result in reduced privacy, and conversely, privacy-enhancing technologies tend to improve fungibility as well. 

Domokos Miklós Kelen and [István András Seres](https://twitter.com/Istvan_A_Seres/status/1590198490541744129) ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-11th---wabisabi-and-coinpool), [05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-3rd---hackers-congress-paraleln%C3%AD-polis), [07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-3rd---privacy-in-cross-layer-interactions), [10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-13th---quick-and-discreet-lightning-and-dlcs), [20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#may-2nd---financial-cryptography-and-data-security-2022)) have published a new paper, "[Towards Measuring The Fungibility and Anonymity of Cryptocurrencies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04259.pdf)." On the basis that "there is currently no formal quantitative framework" for money or cryptocurrencies," they "apply absorbing Markov chains combined with Shannon entropy" to "both the stationary and the temporal transaction graph variants for each network" (mainly Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Zcash), with the goal to "help users select the coin with sufficient fungibility/ anonymity required to perform a privacy-critical transaction."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Generally, we can observe many different fungibility characteristics in the studied cryptocurrency networks. Some of the results are largely unsurprising, such as the relatively low mean expected number of steps in account-based currencies, as account balances can quickly absorb random walks. Similarly, a significant fungibility variance in Zcash is expected, as different kinds of transactions exhibit different fungibility characteristics.

## November 21st - ANTI-CBDC CAMPAIGNS

> Arguably, the advent of cryptocurrencies has provided much of the impetus behind the possible creation of a U.S. CBDC. Scholars and policymakers alike are intrigued by the potential of the various technologies associated with cryptocurrencies. But this doesn't mean that an eventual U.S. CBDC would necessarily look anything like a cryptocurrency. Indeed, a U.S. CBDC might employ little or none of those technologies. Instead, it may end up looking a lot like forms of digital money that long preceded the introduction of cryptocurrencies.

This month, Bitcoin activist artist '[cryptograffiti](https://cryptograffiti.com/pages/about-us)' [launched](https://twitter.com/NoCBDC/status/1594745336395874313) a '[NoCBDC](https://twitter.com/NoCBDC)' [campaign](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti/status/1581673121601359872), warning about the risks of CBDCs through custom [street signs](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti/status/1595445261886951424) [and stickers](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rr5jea5n35fqybl/%40NOCBDC%20sticker%20sheet.pdf?dl=0). He is renowned for repurposing objects of the fiat money system -- from [paper bills](https://cryptograffiti.com/collections/fine-art/products/black-swan) to [credit cards](https://cryptograffiti.com/collections/fine-art/products/global-disruption) to [bank branch pens](https://cryptograffiti.com/collections/fine-art/products/bank-run) -- to create works that help spread awareness about Bitcoin and what makes it special.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The ['NoCBDC' promotional video](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti/status/1596541065548288001) begins with a question posed to a woman sitting in front of [Cupid's Span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid's_Span) in Rincon Park, San Francisco. "What are CBDCs?" She doesn't know, and neither do the two men he also asks. But these world leaders certainly do: [Rishi Sunak](https://youtu.be/0u8eZcPnWeU), Chancellor of the Exchequer at the [U.K. Treasury](https://www.hmtreasurycareers.co.uk/about-us/role-of-hm-treasury/); [Bo Li](https://youtu.be/2I9HR7BTmn0?t=1095), deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF); [Agustín Carstens](https://youtu.be/mVmKN4DSu3g?t=1476), general manager at the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://www.bis.org/about/bioac.htm); [Christine Lagarde](https://youtu.be/-D9MRkw5wOc), managing director at the IMF; and [Klaus Schwab](https://youtu.be/CVIy3rjuKGY?t=935), founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Alarm bells go off, and the remainder of the video follows the [installation of signs](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti/status/1595445261886951424) and [stickers](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti/status/1593707715498741760) around the city, to the tune of Rockwell's "[Somebody's Watching Me](https://youtu.be/7YvAYIJSSZY)" (1984).

On the same day, [Gladstein](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1594813814872367106) announced [the opportunity for an 8-month paid fellowship](https://hrf.org/cbdctracker/) to create an online interactive resource that "tracks the progress of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in every country in the world and flags their risks for civil liberties, with a focus on authoritarian regimes."

##### UNITED STATES

Since September 21st, [**Fight For The Future**](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1572647435209682944) (FFTF) and "[a dozen civil society organizations including the ACLU](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2022-09-20-no-spy-cash-aclu-fight-for-the-future-and-more-demand-any-digital-dollar-be-as-private-as-cash-2)" have supported the '[NoSpyCash](https://www.nospycash.com/)' campaign and petition to "preserve the inclusive, human rights respecting qualities of cash in any efforts to create a digital dollar."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The campaign comes on the heels of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issuing a [**new report**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/16/technical-possibilities-for-a-u-s-central-bank-digital-currency/) that promotes the idea of a certain sort of digital currency — a CBDC issued by the Central Bank rather than a digital dollar from the US Mint — and one that has government surveillance and control built in. 

On November 29th, [FFTF](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1592608122429792256) and [Amnesty International USA](https://twitter.com/amnestyusa/status/1595039668151914497) hosted a virtual salon "[to discuss the privacy concerns raised by government-backed digital currencies](https://amnestyusa-org.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_RJDYW6cbQ9uuZQANN1Sh9g)." Panelists included:

https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1595517670484766720

Artists and activists are not the only ones putting up resistance to the implementation of a CBDC. On September 7th, members of the [U.S. House Committee on Financial Services](https://financialservices.house.gov/) had [written](https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/UploadedFiles/2022-09-07_FSC_GOP_Letter_to_Vice_Chair_Brainard_FINAL_FINAL.pdf) to Federal Reserve vice chair [Lael Brainard](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/brainard.htm) "[regarding the Fed’s authority to issue a CBDC absent specific authorizing legislation from Congress](https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408412)," among other follow-up questions to [Brainard's testimony](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/brainard20220526a.htm) during their May virtual hearing, "[Digital Assets and the Future of Finance: Examining the Benefits and Risks of a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency](https://financialservices.house.gov/events/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=409382)." The letter requested that she respond by no later than September 30th; it is unclear whether she did, but according to [a letter the Committee sent to Garland](https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408448) in October, they believe "[the Federal Reserve does not have the legal authority to issue a CBDC absent action from Congress. Both Federal Reserve Chair Powell and Vice Chair Lael Brainard have also testified on the need for authorizing legislation](https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2022-10-05_digital_assets_working_group_letter_on_cbdc_assesment_finalupdated.pdf)." As Anthony cited in [his commentary](https://www.cato.org/blog/house-committee-demands-answers-cbdc), the [Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2022/q2_federal_reserve) has also written:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The Fed expressed reluctance to get into retail banking (a move that might require congressional authorization). Instead, the white paper favored an intermediated approach that would work through private financial institutions to take advantage of their existing systems for complying with anti-money laundering laws and Know Your Client laws.

On November 18th, [Anthony](https://twitter.com/EconWithNick/status/1594695023743885313) and Michel released a new working paper arguing that "[Congress should explicitly prohibit the Federal Reserve (the Fed) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) from issuing a CBDC in any form](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2022-11/working-paper-70.pdf)." They counter the claims of "financial inclusion," "faster payments," "preserving the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency," and "improv[ing] the implementation of monetary and fiscal policy," and then touch on the threats "to financial privacy, financial freedom, free markets, and cyber security that a CBDC would pose." The final section makes several recommendations for how Congress could limit the Fed and Treasury legislatively.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Regarding cash usage and the un(der)banked, the paper includes the following:

> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) survey of the underbanked and unbanked households in America reveals that the issue of financial inclusion is more nuanced than solely being a question of "access."<sup>7</sup> Over 72% of the unbanked households surveyed said that they were not interested in having a bank account (Figure 1).[<sup>8</sup>](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2021report.pdf) When asked why they feel this way, respondents most commonly said that they lack enough money to open an account, avoid the banking system to secure their privacy, and have a distrust for banks in general (Figure 2).[<sup>9</sup>](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2021report.pdf)

Relatedly, in "[The Future of Money and Payments](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Future-of-Money-and-Payments.pdf)" report prepared by the Treasury for the Biden administration, they state that "the percentage of the United States that is unbanked is higher than the percentage in all other G-7 countries.[<sup>42</sup>](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex/Data)" Figures 1 and 2 show the results of surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve, most recently "[2022 Findings from the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice](https://www.frbsf.org/cash/publications/fed-notes/2022/may/2022-findings-from-the-diary-of-consumer-payment-choice/)," regarding payment method choices made by consumers between 2016 and 2021. During this period, they found that while cash as a medium has gone down from 31% to 21% of payments (credit cards have increased from 18% to 28%), it is still the primary payment method (36% of payments) for those with an annual household income below $25,000.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On the topic of CBDCs, the Treasury report states that because it "could potentially be used at much greater scale and velocity," a design as anonymous as cash would be too risky, and then seems to echo the 'threshold' model suggested by the [**European Central Bank**](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/profuse/shared/files/dedocs/ecb.dedocs220404.en.pdf?39c27f3bda85972b8070c318bb4e3578) ([TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-14th---cbdcs-in-emerging-market-economies)):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> These risks could be more easily mitigated in an identity-verified system, in which intermediaries collect and verify customer information. Other strategies, including zero knowledge proofs, could also be explored. A CBDC could also have tiered accounts to allow for different functionality, tied to different levels of identity verification and monitoring. Controls could be embedded into the design of any tiered system to enable intermediaries to identify instances of structuring designed to avoid compliance thresholds. Tiered accounts could enable customers without identity credentials, who are often unable to access traditional financial services, to access CBDC. While models that allow different levels of identity verification and monitoring could reach wider user bases and do more to promote inclusion than accounts requiring full customer due diligence, they would need to be carefully assessed and calibrated to appropriately mitigate the illicit financing risks. In addition, a tiered model would need to regularly assess the illicit finance risks and, if necessary, change the tiering to adapt to an ever-changing risk environment.

##### EUROPE

Back in March, the ECB released "[commissioned research on citizens’ payment habits and their attitudes towards digital payments in order to gain a deeper understanding of user preferences as part of the digital euro project](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2022/html/ecb.pr220330~309dbc7098.en.html)." Like the Federal Reserve surveys, they found "[the main payment method used by unbanked, underbanked and offline individuals is cash](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/profuse/shared/files/dedocs/ecb.dedocs220330_report.en.pdf)." When the "general public and tech-savvy participants were asked to imagine a future where most payments are digital," and what features were most important to them, "instant payments, universal acceptance and risk-freeness are non-negotiable features."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op201.en.pdf

More importantly, this report provided insight into what is envisioned regarding the privacy 'thresholds' ([TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-14th---cbdcs-in-emerging-market-economies), [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-2nd---cbdcs-in-major-market-economies)). "Three different privacy settings" for a theoretical digital euro wallet were offered: 'high,' 'medium,' and 'low.' The so-calld "high privacy setting" allowed users to "download money" that would be "usable even when there is no internet or phone connection," and "payments remain private as long as they do not exceed the legal limit for compliance," restricted to just "lower value payments (e.g. <€150) and not for online shopping." Unsurprisingly, most preferred the so-called "medium privacy setting," which required that "the user’s bank stores the user’s personal data and monitors the transactions, including for small amounts," but does not impose spending limits:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> A medium level of financial privacy is preferred for the new wallet, as it avoids the restrictions imposed by the high setting and the advertising found with the low setting. However, most participants say privacy is not a key feature. They assume that no truly private digital transaction is possible, so privacy is not something they really think about. Nevertheless, most participants would like to have the choice to opt for a privacy level according to the payment situation.

On July 13th, the ECB published a document summarising "[key objectives and design considerations](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/key_objectives_digital_euro~f11592d6fb.en.pdf?c8e830557da716fd7a77dd7c52111d30)" for the digital euro, stating unequivocally that "it would complement cash, not replace it." They recognised that the decline in cash usage weakened "the strategic autonomy of European payments and monetary sovereignty," particularly "in the event of geopolitical tensions," given that "most electronic payments solutions are at present run by companies with headquarters outside the European Union." According to [**CoinDesk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1570449326618595328), a supposedly leaked paper "[authored by senior Treasury officials from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/15/digital-euro-must-be-green-private-and-possibly-capped-national-officials-say/)" echoed similar concerns, suggesting a "digital euro could play a vital role to strengthen the strategic autonomy of the European Union."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The lesson Russia learned in February was also learned by the Canadian truckers (and many others in recent history) and brings into sharp relief a question that hits at the core of the current monetary and political arrangement; what is money and who has the power to decide? Money is an expression of power. The power to decide what is money — and who can or cannot use it — is a unique and consequential power. How such power is wielded — whether in the hands of a state, across blocs of competing states or among a distributed consensus of individuals — will shape much of the future.

On September 29th, the ECB released a progress report "[on the investigation phase](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/governance/shared/files/ecb.degov220929.en.pdf?8eec0678b57e98372a7ae6b59047604b)," which "elaborates on the foundational design options that were recently endorsed by the Governing Council." The [Governing Council](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/govc/html/index.en.html), headed by [Lagarde](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/html/cvlagarde.en.html), plans to make a decision on whether to advance into the "realisation phase" in autumn 2023. In the section on privacy, they define the "baseline scenario" as one where "a digital euro would provide a level of privacy equal to that of current private sector digital solutions[<sup>18</sup>](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220330_1%7Ef9fa9a6137.en.html)" and only promise to "explore two options" with co-legislators that "go beyond this baseline scenario.[<sup>19</sup>](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/governance/shared/files/ecb.degov220404_privacy.en.pdf?4e685f580522c42f6d84d694a00718e4) These could allow the digital euro to replicate some cash-like features and enable greater privacy for low-value/low-risk payments."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Further work is needed to explore how the two options could be enabled in the regulatory framework (e.g. how to exempt low-value/low-risk digital euro transactions from certain AML/CFT obligations).[<sup>22</sup>](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/governance/shared/files/ecb.degov220404_privacy.en.pdf?4e685f580522c42f6d84d694a00718e4) In this context, the Eurosystem is in discussions with the Commission and European Data Protection Authorities.

On October 10th, the [European Data Protection Board](https://twitter.com/EU_EDPB/status/1580107795395137537) (EDPB), chaired by [Andrea Jelinek](https://iapp.org/about/person/0011a00000jJKkDAAW/), issued [a statement](https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2022/edpb-adopts-wish-list-procedural-aspects-first-eu-data-protection-seal-and-statement_en) on the digital euro project; this follows [their](https://twitter.com/EU_EDPB/status/1541682294930513920) [detailed](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/other-guidance/response-edpb-european-commissions-targeted_en) [consultation](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2022-06/edpb_responseconsultation_20220614_digitaleuro_en.pdf) submitted to the Commission in June. They caution "[against the use of systematic validation and tracing of all transactions in digital euros](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2022-10/edpb_statement_20221010_digital_euro_en.pdf)," and argue that "the design choices adopted by the ECB should be based on a documented impact assessment of all risks concerned still privileging innovative, privacy enhancing technologies (such as e-cash, Zero Knowledge Proof)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In order to meet the policy objectives enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the European Charter of Fundamental rights and the high privacy standard that only the public sector can offer, it might not always be appropriate to foresee a validation of transactions by a third party. The regulatory checks, if needed, as a rule should be run ex post and on a targeted basis, in the presence of a specific AML/CFT risk. A validation of all (each and every) transactions in digital euros might not be in line with the data protection principles of necessity and proportionality, as interpreted by CJEU case law.<sup>6</sup>
> 
> ... Furthermore, the EDPB recommends the digital euro to be modelled as closely as possible to a peer-to-peer modality, available both offline and online, as opposed to an account-based model.

Like the [OFF panel in May](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd6jXAeNPAM), we were in agreement that CBDCs were bad news for various reasons. Regarding the digital euro project, De Baukelaer said that the plans seem to be changing month to month. "[When you begin a project [out of] fear, it's rarely a good idea... What I feel is, for sure, there will be no anonymity... There is no advantage for us, for the citizen](https://youtu.be/ZK9c5J6OKK8)."

## November 28th - LEGENDS OF LIGHTNING FINALIST: NOLOOKING

In [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-4th---onion78-wins-mit-bitcoin-expo-2021-track), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-16th---chaincase-coinjoin-on-ios), [TMIBP13](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2021/#june-6th---chaincase-payjoin-demo), [TMIBP16](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2021/#september-14th---hrf-grants-to-chaincase-umbrel-bounty), [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-13th---wasabi-coordinator-agrees-to-blacklist), and [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#august-1st---chaincase-closed), I have featured progress with **Chaincase**, an iOS client based on **Wasabi**. While the original beta wallet was [sunset](https://chaincase.app/words/sunset-ios-testflight-beta-export-guide) on November 1st, the project has since pivoted to [combining PayJoin and Lightning](https://chaincase.app/words/lightning-payjoin).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [Funding channels on a lightning node can be a pain. First, I need to send funds to my node on-chain. Then I need to make another transaction to open channels. Instead, we can use the BIP 78 PayJoin P2EP protocol to fund and open channels in a single transaction](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021180.html).

On October 14th, lead developer [Dan Gould](https://twitter.com/bitgould/status/1580771878222061568) [opened](https://makers.bolt.fun/story/introducing-nolooking--182) the '[NoLooking](https://nolooking.chaincase.app/)' [project](https://twitter.com/chaincaseapp/status/1581742677582024704) as part of the six-week [Legends of Lightning](https://twitter.com/boltfun_btc/status/1572251737120964613) [online global development tournament](https://makers.bolt.fun/tournaments/1/overview). He had [publicly announced](https://twitter.com/bitgould/status/1579853843760054272) the project a few days prior with co-developers [Armin Sabouri](https://github.com/0xBEEFCAF3) and [Nick Farrow](https://github.com/nickfarrow), and performed a mainnet demo. They [documented](https://makers.bolt.fun/story/week-1-retro-building-the-foundation--229) their progress and problems over the subsequent weeks. By the [second](https://makers.bolt.fun/story/week-2-recap--274) and [third](https://makers.bolt.fun/story/nolooking-week-3-retro--318), they had "experimented" with [Cashu](https://twitter.com/CashuBTC) [e-cash](https://github.com/cashubtc), opened two Lightning channels from a [Sparrow Wallet](https://twitter.com/bitgould/status/1585301587672473600) PayJoin transaction, and a Halloween-themed alpha version of their [app](https://twitter.com/chaincaseapp/status/1589283776823033856) was [running](https://twitter.com/utxoclub/status/1592460852690419712) on [Umbrel](https://makers.bolt.fun/story/try-us-on-umbrel-nolooking--324); by the fourth, the app had "[well over 400 downloads](https://makers.bolt.fun/story/punching-through-week-4--370)." During the [fifth week](https://makers.bolt.fun/story/week-5-nolooking-ppps--414), they focused on "delivering the minimum delightful product.. to the market," and scheduled a public call in December with the [Bitcoin Design](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Meta/issues/419) community to discuss the user experience of PayJoin. On November 23rd, the hackathon's host '[Bolt Fun](https://twitter.com/boltfun_btc/status/1595490674509549592)' livestreamed another '[NoLooking](https://youtu.be/1VetF9c597s)' demo. In the [wrap-up](https://makers.bolt.fun/story/try-nolooking-node-funding-in-1-scan--495), Gould summarised their achievements and future plans, laid out in the "[NoLooking Roadmap](https://github.com/chaincase-app/nolooking/issues/6)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> We want to push beyond hobbyist adoption. In order to get PayJoin as the standard, we need to move into enterprise products and services. To do this, we need introductions to bitcoin organizations who believe in human freedom and are willing to step to the cutting edge.
>
> To smooth this offering, we are in the process of vetting the free and open source code we have built and depend on. We need to get it tested and reviewed by some rust & bitcoin wizards. The easier it is for us to recruit this help, the faster bitcoin gains privacy.
>
> We’re talking livelihoods. It needs to be bulletproof.
>
> The window for us to deliver privacy as an alternative to the CBDC pantopticon may be running out. Legends of Lightning has us speeding up.

Project submissions for the tournament [officially](https://legendsoflightning.substack.com/p/final-day-of-hacking) [closed](https://legendsoflightning.substack.com/p/submissions-are-closed) on November 24th, and [the judges](https://youtu.be/4f7Gx2up5EI) announced a shortlist of finalists for each track on Nov 28th. '[NoLooking](https://twitter.com/boltfun_btc/status/1597303131117088770)' was included in the list of ten finalists for the Global Adoption track.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The finalists will then get an extra week to continue working on their projects, putting in any extra features or finishing touches. On Dec 6th, we will host a Finals day live stream for each track, giving founders a chance to re-pitch their projects live to the world! (This can also be done with a pre-recorded pitch). Our judges will then rescore the projects and announce the winners on Dec 7th!

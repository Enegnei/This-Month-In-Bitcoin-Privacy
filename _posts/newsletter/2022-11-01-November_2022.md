#### September 26th - UNREDACTED MAGAZINE

In April, Michael Bazzell, author of "[Extreme Privacy: What It Takes to Disappear](https://inteltechniques.com/book7.html)," "[Open Source Intelligence Techniques: Resources for Searching and Analyzing Online Information](https://inteltechniques.com/book1.html)," and host of the weekly "[Privacy, Security and OSINT Show](https://www.inteltechniques.com/podcast.html)," had [announced the launch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/258-introducing-unredacted-magazine/id1165843330?i=1000558380784) of [a new independently published magazine](https://unredactedmagazine.com/) focused around the same topics, and inspired by the style of [*2600: The Hacker Quarterly*](https://2600.com/). This month, he [published](https://twitter.com/IntelTechniques/status/1574397289791074304) the fourth issue of [**Unredacted**](https://unredactedmagazine.com/issues/004.pdf), which includes two pieces about Bitcoin privacy: "Bitcoin Privacy Tools & Tactics" and "Tracking Bitcoin: Tools for OSINT" by analyst 'Ergo' (see [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-18th---dust-attacks), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-21st---financial-cancel-culture), and [TMIBP15](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2021/#august-4th---understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt)). The first article outlines "basic building blocks to thwarting effective bitcoin tracking," and the second advertises the features of **Samourai Wallet**'s [OXT](https://oxt.me/) blockchain analysis tool ([TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#february-19th---samourai-bitcoin-privacy-series)) to "OSINT practitioners" interested in "incorporat[ing] bitcoin tracking and information into their investigations."

#### September 30th - EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY ON PRIVACY WALLETS

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-28th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations), I included that the [European Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/12/01/anti-money-laundering-council-agrees-its-negotiating-mandate-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/) had announced "a mandate to negotiate with the European Parliament on a proposal to update existing rules on information accompanying transfers of funds," also known as the 'Funds Transfer Regulation (FTR) / Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR),' with the intent to "extend the scope of the rules to certain crypto-assets" in a way that was 'synchronised' with the ‘Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets' (MiCA). In [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-30th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations-update), I summarised key points of the [provisional agreement](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/29/anti-money-laundering-provisional-agreement-reached-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/) reached in the trilogue negotiations.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

According to [a draft](https://blockworks.co/news/leaked-eu-docs-warn-members-to-clamp-down-on-crypto-mixers) obtained by [**Blockworks**](https://twitter.com/Blockworks_/status/1577380069626023964) [editor and journalist](https://blockworks.co/author/david-canellis) [David Canellis](https://twitter.com/dcanellis/status/1577564040263516160), the amendments to the [FTR/TFR](https://www.eumonitor.eu/9353000/1/j4nvk6yhcbpeywk_j9vvik7m1c3gyxp/vjuo7ak2n0zf) [2015/847](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015R0847) focus on the requirements of crypto asset service providers (CASPs), which include "[any person whose occupation or business is the provision of one or more crypto-asset services to third parties on a professional basis](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593)" (see [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-20th---fatf-report-and-eu-aml-proposals)). They also state that the [European Banking Authority](https://www.eba.europa.eu/about-us/eba-at-a-glance) (EBA):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> shall clarify, in particular, how the risk factors listed in Annex III shall be taken into account by crypto-asset service providers including when performing transactions with persons and entities which are not covered by this Directive. To that end, the EBA shall pay particular attention to products, transactions and technologies that may favor anonymity such as privacy wallets, mixers or tumblers.
>
> Where situations of higher risk are identified, the guidelines shall include enhanced due diligence measures that obliged entities shall consider applying to mitigate such risks, including the adoption of appropriate procedures to detect the origin or destination of crypto-assets.

The guidance published by the [**Financial Action Task Force**](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html) (FATF) last year lists "[the use of anonymizing techniques for VA funds transfers (e.g., AECs, mixing and tumbling services, the clustering of wallet addresses, privacy wallets)](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf)" as an element for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) -- a category of 'obliged entities' essentially equivalent to CASPs -- to consider in their AML/CFT risk assessment ([TMIBP17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-1st---fatf-travel-rule-updates)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Blockchain analytics are also widely used by VASPs and some FIs to monitor their own exposure to risk (e.g., VA transfers that have passed through mixer servicesor come from privacy wallets). It is important to consider any potential implications for privacy and data protection in the use of such tools, if they allow transparency that is not otherwise available (e.g., on public blockchains).

On October 21st, the [EBA](https://twitter.com/EBA_News/status/1584558559932866561) "[issued a call for expression of interest](https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-launches-call-interest-two-expert-groups-and-call-input-advise-its-work-under-recast-funds)" in joining a 'Technical Expert Group' (TEG) that would "provide expertise on the financial crime risks to which CASPs are exposed and challenges that market participants may face when implementing the revised TFR." The deadline for submission of responses was November 15th.

#### October 8th - MY BITCOIN PRIVACY ANNIVERSARY

People often ask, "How did you become interested in [Bitcoin] privacy?" Well, seven years ago on this day, I attended my first ever [Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/coinscrum/status/651779064764760064) [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/coinscrum/events/225895988/) at University College London (UCL). I had already been conscious of Bitcoin for two years, but in comparison to my work today, I basically knew nothing and no one. The topic of the meetup was -- coincidentally -- a paper about coin mixing, "[CoinParty: Secure Multi-Party Mixing of Bitcoins](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1145/2699026.2699100)" by then communication and distributed systems PhD [Jan Henrik Ziegeldorf](https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/team/jan-henrik-ziegeldorf/) et al. from [*Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule* (RWTH) *Aachen*](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1). I understood almost nothing that was said, except this was a proposed method to improve Bitcoin's privacy. While I already deeply cared about personal privacy, if you had told me this would soon become a central professional focus of mine, I don't think I would have believed you.

#### September 6th - DIGITAL ASSETS EXECUTIVE ORDER RESPONSES

Back in March, the Biden administration issued [Executive Order (E.O.) #14067](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/14/2022-05471/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets), "[Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)." U.S. Secretary of State [Antony J. Blinken](https://www.state.gov/biographies/antony-j-blinken/) published [a statement](https://www.state.gov/ensuring-the-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) that "our embassies and missions around the world are ready to partner with the private sector and international bodies to support the development and use of digital asset technology in ways aligned with U.S. values," which supposedly includes "protecting against arbitrary or unlawful surveillance; defending privacy and the exercise of human rights; and supporting financial inclusion." The usual lip service ([TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-14th---cbdcs-in-emerging-market-economies)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> We must support technological advances that promote responsible development and use of digital assets. The technological architecture of different digital assets has substantial implications for privacy, national security, the operational security and resilience of financial systems, climate change, the ability to exercise human rights, and other national goals.

The order required that various secretaries and "heads of other relevant agencies" would "submit to the President a report on the future of money and payment systems" after a certain number of days. To date, the nine reports submitted are:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The Department of Treasury had opened requests for public comment on two topics it was tasked with researching: "[potential opportunities and risks presented by developments and adoption of digital assets](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0861)," and "[the illicit finance and national security risks posed by digital assets](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0961)." The comment periods closed on [August 8th](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/08/2022-14588/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets-request-for-comment) and [November 3rd](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/20/2022-20279/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets-request-for-comment) respectively.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On September 16th, following a [background press call](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/09/16/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-the-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/), the White House published a "[fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)" summarising "frameworks and policy recommendations that advance the six key priorities identified in the EO." *Note: To the staff who wrote this sheet -- would it have killed you to actually cite these "nine reports submitted to the President" somewhere? :confounded: I had to go search for them all separately across different agency websites, with the bureaucratese of the [original order](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/14/2022-05471/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets) as my only guide.*
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

[Garland](https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland)'s report was written in collaboration with "the Department of Justice’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET)," which was formed almost one year ago ([TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#february-17th---justice-departments-ncet-director)). The report also "serves as an update to the Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework" issued under former Attorney General William "Bill" Barr ([TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> It proposes actions designed to enhance law enforcement’s ability to gather evidence and prosecute crimes; strengthen certain laws and penalty provisions that play an important role in digital asset prosecutions; support proposed regulations that would enhance customer-identification efforts and other anti-money-laundering requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act; and ensure that law enforcement and regulatory agencies have adequate resources to conduct the technologically sophisticated investigations inherent in the digital assets space.

Under a sub-section on 'Decentralized Finance (DeFi),' they note that "enforcing applicable statutory and regulatory obligations can be challenging," and "several DeFi projects have affirmatively touted the lack of money laundering controls as one of the primary goals of decentralization," citing **ShapeShift** ([TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-6th---shapeshifting-back)) and Tornado Cash ([TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-8th---darknet-diaries), [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#august-8th---ofac-sanctions-tornado-cash)) as examples.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

After a lengthy third section that exhibits key "U.S. regulatory agencies," their respective roles, and notable cases, the fourth section lists "several legislative and regulatory actions that, in the Department’s view, would facilitate efforts to investigate, prosecute, and otherwise disrupt digital asssets-related criminal activity." This includes "extending the statute of limitations for crimes involving digital assets from five years to ten," and "strengthening of the Sentencing Guidelines applicable to certain BSA violations," such as "tying the base offense level to the amount of funds involved." Regarding the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)'s rulemaking on the collection of personal and financial information of cryptocurrency users (see [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-20th---fincen-proposed-rulemaking-suspended), [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-1st---fincen-proposed-rulemaking-update)), the Justice Department intends to "support FinCEN in enforcing the rule and encouraging its implementation throughout the digital assets industry."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Under the final sub-section 'Proposal to Ensure Adequate Funding of Law Enforcement Operations,' the report urges that "the President’s budget should seek funding from Congress for additional tools and technical resources specific to digital assets that can support investigations and search-and-seizure operations, including blockchain analytical tools and the technical infrastructure (e.g., server space or cloud access) needed to ingest and maintain potentially voluminous and complex data and to analyze that data."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Cato Institute** [Center for Monetary & Financial Alternatives](https://www.cato.org/centers/center-monetary-financial-alternatives) (CMFA) policy analysts [Nicholas Anthony](https://www.cato.org/people/nicholas-anthony) and [Jack Solowey](https://www.cato.org/people/jack-solowey) published their initial commentary on several aspects of the framework, including insights about underlying interagency conflicts. "[When the market is supplying the innovation, the Administration — and Congress — have a responsibility to do no harm](https://www.cato.org/blog/white-houses-statement-cryptocurrency)." On September 19th, Anthony began a five-part series breaking down the reports by the Departments of [Justice](https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-cryptocurrency-reports-part-2-role-law-enforcement-detecting-investigating-prosecuting) and [Commerce](https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-cryptocurrency-reports-part-4-responsible-advancement-us-competitiveness-digital-assets), and [three](https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-cryptocurrency-reports-part-1-action-plan-address-illicit-financing-risks-digital-assets) [from](https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-cryptocurrency-reports-part-3-implications-consumers-investors-businesses) [Treasury](https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-cryptocurrency-reports-part-5-future-money-payments).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> To monitor risks, the Treasury called for the expansion of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) in addition to what is already in the third recommendation. Considering that the BSA [**has been expanded legislatively**](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/revising-bank-secrecy-act-protect-privacy-deter-criminals) through several acts over the years and [**has been expanded practically**](https://www.cato.org/blog/how-inflation-erodes-financial-privacy) through inflation since 1972, further expansions are not warranted until the government can prove how effective the BSA has been. And if [**what evidence that is already available**](https://www.cato.org/blog/how-inflation-erodes-financial-privacy) is any indication, the BSA should be limited or repealed, not expanded.

I have previously included the CMFA's research on financial privacy and surveillance in [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-19th---civil-liberties-versus-digital-mercenaries), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-13th---financial-freedom-and-privacy), and [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-2nd---cbdcs-in-major-market-economies). On October 18th, vice president [Norbert Michel](https://twitter.com/norbertjmichel) and [Jennifer J. Schulp](https://twitter.com/jenniferjschulp) [released](https://twitter.com/CatoInstitute/status/1582382697824993284) "[Restoring Financial Privacy](https://www.cato.org/study/restoring-financial-privacy)," a dynamic study of the BSA's history and impact. Backing up Anthony's claim that it has been "expanded practically," they point out that if the original $10,000 reporting threshold for financial institutions had been adjusted for inflation, it would be "[nearly $75,000 today](https://twitter.com/CatoCMFA/status/1581982898047291394)." On October 27th, [Anthony](https://twitter.com/EconWithNick/status/1586748765658120194) also wrote for the [American Institute for Economic Research](https://www.aier.org/article/fincen-and-fed-proposal-means-less-privacy-more-exclusion/) (AIER) about these reports, and the ineffectiveness of FinCEN:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Despite [FinCEN] Acting Director Das’s claim that the program is effective, it appears to have high costs with little or no benefits. The current regime is estimated to have cost US businesses [$26.4 billion](https://risk.lexisnexis.com/insights-resources/research/2019-true-cost-of-aml-compliance-study-for-united-states-and-canada) in 2019. And while FinCEN has not reported any numbers regarding how many criminals the regime stopped, FinCEN has shared that it received [20 million reports in 2019](https://www.fincen.gov/what-bsa-data). Separately, the [Bank Policy Institute](https://bpi.com/getting-to-effectiveness-report-on-u-s-financial-institution-resources-devoted-to-bsa-aml-sanctions-compliance/) found in 2018 that law enforcement only followed up with banks on 3.85 percent of suspicious activity reports (SARs) and 0.44 percent of currency transaction reports (CTRs). Moreover, [Norbert Michel and David Burton](https://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/report/financial-privacy-free-society) found in 2016 that money-laundering investigations by the FBI had fallen between 2001 and 2011, despite the number of suspicious activity reports rising significantly.
>
> The issue isn’t just one of government waste, though. As the government gathers more data, there continues to be a greater risk that it will use the data. For example, as noted by [Lawrence White](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/spring/summer-2018/curse-war-cash#require-new-reports-on-cross-border-currency-transactions-for-financial-institutions), “Innocent family businesses have been charged with structuring, and had tens of thousands of dollars seized by the federal government, merely for making repeated deposits or withdrawals below the $10,000 [CTR] threshold.” Moreover, Operation Chokepoint, Canada’s [freeze on protestors’ bank accounts](https://www.cato.org/working-paper/crafting-better-framework-financial-privacy-digital-age), and ICE’s recent collection of money-transfer data all showcase how this data is being used to target citizens.

#### September 21st - TREZOR ADDS COIN CONTROL

In [TMIBP11](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2021/#april-9th---trezor-to-add-coinjoin-and-coin-control), I reported that hardware wallet company **Trezor** had plans to support [CoinJoin](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/issues/2745) and [coin control](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/issues/2770) features in their Suite interface. While the CoinJoin part remains in limbo (apparently delayed until at least next year, due to external issues with the implementation of WabiSabi), they finally announced that [version 22.9.3](https://blog.trezor.io/coin-control-in-trezor-suite-92f3455fd706) adds manual coin/ transaction output selection.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Coin control is an advanced feature that allows you to specify which UTXOs you want to spend in a transaction. Used properly, it can improve privacy, though we only recommend that you use it once you are familiar with the principles.
> 
> ... When making a payment, your wallet may need to spend the contents of several UTXOs to make up the total purchase amount. Without Coin control, **your wallet automatically chooses** which to spend, favoring the cheapest option.
>
> Each of those UTXOs has its own lineage of previous transactions, some of which may offer hints that reveal information about you that you don’t want to share. **To protect your privacy**, you can enable Coin control and specify which particular UTXOs to use in a transaction.

In [November](https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1590374260476112899), in collaboration with the peer-to-peer exchange [**Hodl Hodl**](https://twitter.com/hodlhodl/status/1590343563648602113), they also introduced the option to [buy bitcoin](https://trezor.io/learn/a/p2p-with-trezor) from within the Suite, no KYC verification required. Amidst news of [the FTX scandal](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/unpacking-the-ftx-fraud), [**Trezor**](https://blog.trezor.io/bitcoin-without-middlemen-8a76e6073ad8) warned:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Leaving bitcoin on an exchange increases their power and influence. In crypto, many of the tokens that end up collapsing are under the sphere of influence of exchanges, tied to risk-hungry investment firms.
>
> The disrepute brought to Bitcoin by association has repeatedly held back progress and threatened the Bitcoin ecosystem. By giving custody of bitcoin to a major exchange, the majority of people who believe they own bitcoin are in fact centralizing power in the hands of a few entities.
>
> The saying “rules, not rulers” is also often applied to Bitcoin. The golden rule is that whoever controls the keys, controls the Bitcoin. The sooner the broader community learns to take control, the sooner Bitcoin will be decoupled from the influence of playboy economics.

#### September 26th - UNREDACTED MAGAZINE

In April, Michael Bazzell, author of "[Extreme Privacy: What It Takes to Disappear](https://inteltechniques.com/book7.html)," "[Open Source Intelligence Techniques: Resources for Searching and Analyzing Online Information](https://inteltechniques.com/book1.html)," and host of the weekly "[Privacy, Security and OSINT Show](https://www.inteltechniques.com/podcast.html)," had [announced the launch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/258-introducing-unredacted-magazine/id1165843330?i=1000558380784) of [a new independently published magazine](https://unredactedmagazine.com/) focused around the same topics, and inspired by the style of [*2600: The Hacker Quarterly*](https://2600.com/). This month, he [published](https://twitter.com/IntelTechniques/status/1574397289791074304) the fourth issue of [**Unredacted**](https://unredactedmagazine.com/issues/004.pdf), which includes two pieces about Bitcoin privacy: "Bitcoin Privacy Tools & Tactics" and "Tracking Bitcoin: Tools for OSINT" by analyst 'Ergo' (see [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-18th---dust-attacks), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-21st---financial-cancel-culture), and [TMIBP15](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2021/#august-4th---understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt)). The first article outlines "basic building blocks to thwarting effective bitcoin tracking," and the second advertises the features of **Samourai Wallet**'s [OXT](https://oxt.me/) blockchain analysis tool ([TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#february-19th---samourai-bitcoin-privacy-series)) to "OSINT practitioners" interested in "incorporat[ing] bitcoin tracking and information into their investigations."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

#### September 30th - EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY ON PRIVACY WALLETS

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-28th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations), I included that the [European Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/12/01/anti-money-laundering-council-agrees-its-negotiating-mandate-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/) had announced "a mandate to negotiate with the European Parliament on a proposal to update existing rules on information accompanying transfers of funds," also known as the 'Funds Transfer Regulation (FTR) / Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR),' with the intent to "extend the scope of the rules to certain crypto-assets" in a way that was 'synchronised' with the ‘Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets' (MiCA). In [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-30th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations-update), I summarised key points of the [provisional agreement](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/29/anti-money-laundering-provisional-agreement-reached-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/) reached in the trilogue negotiations.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

According to [a draft](https://blockworks.co/news/leaked-eu-docs-warn-members-to-clamp-down-on-crypto-mixers) obtained by [**Blockworks**](https://twitter.com/Blockworks_/status/1577380069626023964) [editor and journalist](https://blockworks.co/author/david-canellis) [David Canellis](https://twitter.com/dcanellis/status/1577564040263516160), the amendments to the [FTR/TFR](https://www.eumonitor.eu/9353000/1/j4nvk6yhcbpeywk_j9vvik7m1c3gyxp/vjuo7ak2n0zf) [2015/847](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015R0847) focus on the requirements of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), which include "[any person whose occupation or business is the provision of one or more crypto-asset services to third parties on a professional basis](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593)" (see [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-20th---fatf-report-and-eu-aml-proposals)). They also state that the [European Banking Authority](https://www.eba.europa.eu/about-us/eba-at-a-glance) (EBA):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> shall clarify, in particular, how the risk factors listed in Annex III shall be taken into account by crypto-asset service providers including when performing transactions with persons and entities which are not covered by this Directive. To that end, the EBA shall pay particular attention to products, transactions and technologies that may favor anonymity such as privacy wallets, mixers or tumblers.
>
> Where situations of higher risk are identified, the guidelines shall include enhanced due diligence measures that obliged entities shall consider applying to mitigate such risks, including the adoption of appropriate procedures to detect the origin or destination of crypto-assets.

The guidance published by the [**Financial Action Task Force**](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html) (FATF) last year lists "[the use of anonymizing techniques for VA funds transfers (e.g., AECs, mixing and tumbling services, the clustering of wallet addresses, privacy wallets)](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf)" as an element for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) -- a category of 'obliged entities' essentially equivalent to CASPs -- to consider in their AML/CFT risk assessment ([TMIBP17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-1st---fatf-travel-rule-updates)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Blockchain analytics are also widely used by VASPs and some FIs to monitor their own exposure to risk (e.g., VA transfers that have passed through mixer servicesor come from privacy wallets). It is important to consider any potential implications for privacy and data protection in the use of such tools, if they allow transparency that is not otherwise available (e.g., on public blockchains).

On October 21st, the [EBA](https://twitter.com/EBA_News/status/1584558559932866561) "[issued a call for expression of interest](https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-launches-call-interest-two-expert-groups-and-call-input-advise-its-work-under-recast-funds)" in joining a 'Technical Expert Group' (TEG) that would "provide expertise on the financial crime risks to which CASPs are exposed and challenges that market participants may face when implementing the revised TFR." The deadline for submission of responses was November 15th.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On November 15th, [**CoinDesk**](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1592478584135995392) regulatory reporter [Jack Schickler](https://twitter.com/jackschickler), who was [formerly](https://be.linkedin.com/in/jack-schickler) "[a speechwriter and policy analyst at the European Commission](https://www.coindesk.com/author/jschickler/)" and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), wrote about "[a leaked draft of a money laundering bill](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/15/privacy-enhancing-crypto-coins-could-be-banned-under-leaked-eu-plans/)." To be clear, like MiCA, it does not appear that this draft bill would ban the use of privacy coins by private individuals:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> "Credit institutions, financial institutions and crypto-asset service providers shall be prohibited from keeping ...anonymity-enhancing coins," said a legislative draft seen by CoinDesk, dated Nov. 9, which has been circulated to the bloc's other 26 member states for comment.
> 
> ... The Czech proposal responds to a demand from countries negotiating the text, said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on negotiations taking place behind closed doors.

#### October 8th - MY BITCOIN PRIVACY ANNIVERSARY

People often ask, "How did you become interested in [Bitcoin] privacy?" Well, seven years ago on this day, I attended my first ever [Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/coinscrum/status/651779064764760064) [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/coinscrum/events/225895988/) at University College London (UCL). I had already been conscious of Bitcoin for two years, but in comparison to my work today, I basically knew nothing and no one. The topic of the meetup was -- coincidentally -- a paper about coin mixing, "[CoinParty: Secure Multi-Party Mixing of Bitcoins](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1145/2699026.2699100)" by then communication and distributed systems PhD [Jan Henrik Ziegeldorf](https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/team/jan-henrik-ziegeldorf/) et al. from [*Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule* (RWTH) *Aachen*](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1). I understood almost nothing that was said, except this was a proposed method to improve Bitcoin's privacy. While I already deeply cared about personal privacy, if you had told me this would soon become a central professional focus of mine, I don't think I would have believed you!

#### October 10th - SAVE THE ONION ROUTER CAMPAIGN

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-11th---bip155-and-tor-onions-v3), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-23rd---release-candidate-testing), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-14th---bitcoin-core-v021-released), and [TMIBP16](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2021/#september-19th---bisq-transitions-to-tor-v3) I have followed the Tor v3 transition and the importance of [network privacy](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/tags/#network-privacy). Since June, the [Tor](https://status.torproject.org/) [network](https://metrics.torproject.org/torperf.html) has been under a [distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) atack](https://status.torproject.org/issues/2022-06-09-network-ddos/) that remains unresolved ([TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#july-12th---beta-launch-of-tunnel-sats)).

On November 16th, he shared [a technical guide for managing multiple relays](https://github.com/RiccardoMasutti/STOR). According to the site's counter, over $10,000 has been raised so far, in addition to "a big private donation that will be sent directly to" the **Tor Project**.

#### October 11th - ZK-ROLLUP RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP UPDATE

> Given the large amount of excitement and investment going into rollup technology, and given the alignment of trustless validity rollups with the trustless ethos of bitcoin, one might wonder: are validity rollups a good fit for bitcoin, too? To answer this question, we must first take a step back and answer the more foundational questions: Is it even technically possible to build validity rollups on bitcoin? And if it is technically possible to build validity rollups on bitcoin, what would be the benefits, costs, and risks associated with doing so?[<sup>51</sup>](https://hrf.org/zkrollups)

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-9th---zk-rollup-research-fellowship) and [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#may-6th---zk-rollup-research-fellowship-update), I followed John Light's [research fellowship](https://github.com/john-light/zkrollups/blob/main/library.md) into zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups for Bitcoin. This month, he [published](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1579856946781298688) his [extensive final report](https://bitcoinrollups.org/), with over 20,000 words and almost two hundred citations:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Regarding terminology: these protocols are often called "zk-rollups." This can be a misnomer, since not all protocols called "zk-rollups" use "zero knowledge" proofs. But they do all use validity proofs! So for the report I used the more accurate term "validity rollup."

He first outlines the history of both zero-knowledge proofs and, more recently, blockchain scaling solutions, particularly off-chain transaction execution protocols like payment channels on the Lightning Network. Next, he proceeds to define validity rollups, their variants, how they function in practice, and what has been learned from existing implementations, such as [shielded transaction rollups on Ethereum](https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztecs-zk-zk-rollup-looking-behind-the-cryptocurtain-2b8af1fca619).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In the years since Satoshi Nakamoto first contemplated how zk proofs could be used to improve bitcoin privacy, cryptographers have invented new protocols that greatly improve the quality and usability of private cryptocurrency transactions. Validity rollups make it possible to implement these new privacy protocols on bitcoin while inheriting the full ownership security of BTC owned on L1. This would provide bitcoin users with state-of-the-art privacy without having to give up self-custody of their BTC. Additionally, with a flexible enough proof verification system implemented in the bitcoin consensus rules, bitcoin can be future-proofed so that new advancements in privacy protocols can be adopted without requiring any further consensus-level changes to bitcoin.
> 
> ... Despite the popularity of using Turing-complete programming languages to build rollup smart contracts, it would be possible to build a validity rollup on bitcoin using bitcoin’s native Turing-incomplete programming language, Script, with relatively small changes (in terms of code footprint) to the opcodes Script supports.

The final sections explore the (mostly technical) costs and risks in terms of bandwidth, data storage, verification, miner extractable value (MEV) and algorithmic incentive manipulation (AIM) attacks, vulnerabilities in the cryptographic proof system that allow for supply inflation, and lastly "the possibility of provoking a crackdown on bitcoin by authoritarian governments who may be opposed to the strong privacy and censorship-resistant applications these protocols enable."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Discussion about the potential of validity rollups for Bitcoin continued on the [developer mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/020998.html) with [Greg Sanders](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021004.html), [Adam Gibson](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021153.html), [Trey Del Bonis](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021164.html), [Russell O'Connor](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021165.html), and '[ZmnSCPxj](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021166.html).'

## November 21st - ANTI-CBDC CAMPAIGNS

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-27th---chimeras-of-central-bank-digital-currency), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-13th---financial-freedom-and-privacy), [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-4th---the-freedom-of-bitcoin), [TMIBP17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-9th---a-future-under-central-bank-digital-currency), [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-14th---cbdcs-in-emerging-market-economies), and [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-2nd---cbdcs-in-major-market-economies), I have followed exploration, promotion, and criticism of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This month, Bitcoin activist artist '[cryptograffiti](https://cryptograffiti.com/pages/about-us)' [launched](https://twitter.com/NoCBDC/status/1594745336395874313) a '[NoCBDC](https://twitter.com/NoCBDC)' [campaign](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti/status/1581673121601359872), warning about the risks of CBDCs through custom [street signs](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti/status/1595445261886951424) [and stickers](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rr5jea5n35fqybl/%40NOCBDC%20sticker%20sheet.pdf?dl=0). He is renowned for repurposing objects of the fiat money system -- from [paper bills](https://cryptograffiti.com/collections/fine-art/products/black-swan) to [credit cards](https://cryptograffiti.com/collections/fine-art/products/global-disruption) to [bank branch pens](https://cryptograffiti.com/collections/fine-art/products/bank-run) -- to create works that help spread awareness about Bitcoin and what makes it special.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The ['NoCBDC' promotional video](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti/status/1596541065548288001) begins with a question posed to a woman sitting in front of [Cupid's Span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid's_Span) in Rincon Park, San Francisco. "What are CBDCs?" She doesn't know, and neither do the two men he also asks. But these world leaders certainly do: [Rishi Sunak](https://youtu.be/0u8eZcPnWeU), Chancellor of the Exchequer at the [U.K. Treasury](https://www.hmtreasurycareers.co.uk/about-us/role-of-hm-treasury/); [Bo Li](https://youtu.be/2I9HR7BTmn0?t=1095), deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF); [Agustín Carstens](https://youtu.be/mVmKN4DSu3g?t=1476), general manager at the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://www.bis.org/about/bioac.htm); [Christine Lagarde](https://youtu.be/-D9MRkw5wOc), managing director at the IMF; and [Klaus Schwab](https://youtu.be/CVIy3rjuKGY?t=935), founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Alarm bells go off, and the remainder of the video follows the [installation of signs](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti/status/1595445261886951424) and [stickers](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti/status/1593707715498741760) around the city, to the tune of Rockwell's "[Somebody's Watching Me](https://youtu.be/7YvAYIJSSZY)" (1984).

#### September 26th - UNREDACTED MAGAZINE

In April, Michael Bazzell, author of "[Extreme Privacy: What It Takes to Disappear](https://inteltechniques.com/book7.html)," "[Open Source Intelligence Techniques: Resources for Searching and Analyzing Online Information](https://inteltechniques.com/book1.html)," and host of the weekly "[Privacy, Security and OSINT Show](https://www.inteltechniques.com/podcast.html)," had [announced the launch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/258-introducing-unredacted-magazine/id1165843330?i=1000558380784) of [a new independently published magazine](https://unredactedmagazine.com/) focused around the same topics, and inspired by the style of [*2600: The Hacker Quarterly*](https://2600.com/). This month, he [published](https://twitter.com/IntelTechniques/status/1574397289791074304) the fourth issue of [**Unredacted**](https://unredactedmagazine.com/issues/004.pdf), which includes two pieces about Bitcoin privacy: "Bitcoin Privacy Tools & Tactics" and "Tracking Bitcoin: Tools for OSINT" by analyst 'Ergo' (see [TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-18th---dust-attacks), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-21st---financial-cancel-culture), and [TMIBP15](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2021/#august-4th---understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt)). The first outlines "basic building blocks to thwarting effective bitcoin tracking," and the second advertises the features of **Samourai Wallet**'s [OXT](https://oxt.me/) blockchain analysis tool ([TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#february-19th---samourai-bitcoin-privacy-series)) to "OSINT practitioners" interested in "incorporat[ing] bitcoin tracking and information into their investigations."

#### October 8th - MY BITCOIN PRIVACY ANNIVERSARY

People often ask, "How did you become interested in [Bitcoin] privacy?" Well, seven years ago on this day, I attended my first ever [Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/coinscrum/status/651779064764760064) [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/coinscrum/events/225895988/) at University College London (UCL). I had already been conscious of Bitcoin for two years, but in comparison to my work today, I basically knew nothing and no one. The topic of the meetup was -- coincidentally -- a paper about coin mixing, "[CoinParty: Secure Multi-Party Mixing of Bitcoins](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1145/2699026.2699100)" by then communication and distributed systems PhD [Jan Henrik Ziegeldorf](https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/team/jan-henrik-ziegeldorf/) et al. from *Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Technische Hochschule* (RWTH) *Aachen*. I understood almost nothing that was said, except this was a proposed method to improve Bitcoin's privacy. While I already deeply cared about personal privacy, if you had told me this would soon become a central professional focus of mine, I don't think I would have believed you.

#### May 2nd - FINANCIAL CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY 2022

In [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-3rd---privacy-in-cross-layer-interactions) and [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-21st---empirical-analysis-of-lightning-privacy), I highlighted Bitcoin privacy-related research that was featured at last year's Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC21) conference. This year's [FC22 event](https://fc22.ifca.ai/program.html) took place during the first week of May, and once again there were a few papers focused on privacy. István András Seres ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-11th---wabisabi-and-coinpool), [05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-3rd---hackers-congress-paraleln%C3%AD-polis), [07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-3rd---privacy-in-cross-layer-interactions), [10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-13th---quick-and-discreet-lightning-and-dlcs)) co-authored a paper on [Fuzzy Message Detection](https://fc22.ifca.ai/preproceedings/9.pdf) (FMD). Two of the papers in 'Session 6: Mostly Payment Networks' focused on privacy, "[Hide & Seek: Privacy-Preserving Rebalancing on Payment Channel Networks](https://fc22.ifca.ai/preproceedings/152.pdf)" by [Zeta Avarikioti](https://disco.ethz.ch/alumni/ageorgia) et al., and "[Resurrecting Address Clustering in Bitcoin](https://fc22.ifca.ai/preproceedings/87.pdf)" by **Chainalysis** software engineer [Malte Möser](https://maltemoeser.de/) and Princeton associate professor [Arvind Narayanan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/arvindn), in which they "tackle several challenges of change address identification and clustering" and "develop new techniques to predict change outputs with low false positive rates." (It is worth noting that the [latter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KSF1km9YXU) was funded by the Ripple University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), which is known to be [pushing poorly supported anti-Bitcoin 'research'](https://www.quora.com/Is-Ripple-funding-propaganda-against-Bitcoin?share=1), and that event sponsors include platinum-tier **CipherTrace** and gold-tier **Chainalysis**.)
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

#### May 6th - ZK-ROLLUP RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP UPDATE

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-9th---zk-rollup-research-fellowship), I included the **Human Rights Foundation**'s research fellowship into zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups for Bitcoin. John Light opened a [research library](https://github.com/john-light/zkrollups/blob/main/library.md) "[where I'll be dumping links as I come across interesting resources](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1522691477805096965)." He [shared](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1526722422619131906) an extensive post by developer [Trey Del Bonis](https://tr3y.io/articles/crypto/bitcoin-zk-rollups.html) on the subject:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> While current rollup implementations are very dependent on how Ethereum-style contracts store state and represent settlement, there is no fundamental reason that a UTXO-based ledger cannot support rollups. In this article I aim to explore and sketch out some designs for how a zk rollup might function on a future version of Bitcoin that supports some additional script primitives.
> 
> ... If the rollup involves a small set of parties that make many transactions and for some reason “just using Lightning” isn’t an option, then it may make sense to have an alternate spending path that just takes a signature from all of them and they can all consent to the state transition without having to rely on the chain to enforce the logic. This would be improved by using a taproot output which increases privacy and chain space. Failing that, we could still rely on script to encourage liveness.

#### May 8th - JOINMARKET ADDS ONION-BASED MESSAGING

The latest [v0.9.6](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/releases/tag/v0.9.6) release of [JoinMarket](https://twitter.com/joinmarket) now makes it a requirement to run Tor, because they are replacing their reliance on IRC servers with "quasi-p2p onion-based messaging." [Adam Gibson](https://x0f.org/@waxwing/) wrote a guide on "[how to setup onion message channels in JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/onion-message-channels.md)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The TLDR is that makers serve Tor onions, and after initial rendezvous on "directory nodes", most of the transaction negotiation can happen peer to peer. IRC is still configured and will be for some time. All the message channels are used redundantly.

On May 14th, [v0.6.8](https://github.com/openoms/joininbox/releases/tag/v0.6.8) of [JoinInBox](https://twitter.com/openoms/status/1525391239042015233) ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-21st---introducing-joininbox), [03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-4th---hrf-grants-to-joininbox-zeus-fully-noded), [05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-13th---bip78-payjoin-receiver-in-joinmarket), [10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-9th---joinmarket-privacy-bugfix)) was also released.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Similarly, on May 29th, the Lightning and onion-based exchange [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) announced that they had "[just implemented the most transparent and easy to audit E2E chat](https://twitter.com/RoboSats/status/1530699837133443072)" based on the [OpenPGP standard](https://www.openpgp.org/).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Every robot avatar has a pair of PGP keys. These are encrypted with your high entropy token, the same token that is double hashed to generate the avatar. Of course, only you know your token! On the chat, every message you send is encrypted for your peer's public key and signed with your private key. Only he can reads them. Same for his messages: only you can read them.
>
> With single click on the 'Export' button you save the PGP credentials and messages (encrypted, decrypted and signature checked). In case of a dispute, your counterpart won't be able to tell a different story to the staff... you can prove otherwise: you have his signed messages!
> 
> The coolest thing is that you can copy or export every PGP key and message into any other OpenPGP tool (GnuPG, OpenKeychain...). And verify for yourself every message if you do not trust the RoboSats client app (Don't trust, verify)

#### May 12th - PLAID CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT UPDATE

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-1st---class-action-lawsuit-against-plaid-inc) and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-17th---how-private-is-my-pay-app), I covered class action lawsuits and anti-trust complaints against Plaid Inc., a financial technology and identity verification company. The final approval hearing for settlement occurred on May 12th, "[where the Court may hear arguments concerning the approval of the Settlement](https://www.plaidsettlement.com/index.php)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Under the Settlement, Plaid has agreed to minimize the data it stores going forward, to delete certain previously retrieved data, and to improve and maintain certain already-implemented enhancements to Plaid Link. Class Members are also able to view and manage the connections they've made between their financial accounts and chosen applications using Plaid, and delete data stored in Plaid's systems by creating a Plaid Portal account, at my.plaid.com.
>
> In addition, the Settlement establishes a $58 million Settlement Fund, to be used for cash payments to Class Members who submit valid claims for compensation, after deducting the costs of the settlement administration, court-approved attorneys' fees and expenses, and Service Awards for eleven Class Representatives.

#### May 26th - MINING POOL INTEGRATES PAYNYMS 

The small Vancouver-based Bitcoin mining pool operator [Lincoin Technologies](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.lincoin_technologies_inc.e349b104583a01a876e209cf14618733.html) announced that they had integrated BIP-47 PayNyms ([TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-20th---dirtcoin-diaries-paynym-torch), [06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-30th---introducing-soroban), [09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-15th---new-bip47-draft-and-paynym-torch), [10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-15th---signal-accepts-bitcoin-donations)) for their reward payouts, with the goal of "[setting new standards for the industry](https://twitter.com/LincoinPool/status/1529853127003779072)." In the following days, they published [instructions](https://lincoin.com/how-to-set-up-paynym-bip47-on-your-lincoin-pool-account/) for how to enable them, and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/LincoinPool/status/1531324776072982528) about why PayNyms were superior to static addresses or xPubs ([TMIBP03](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2020/#august-27th---what-is-an-xpub)):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> 1. Static Address: This is the most insecure method that breaches your privacy. The Spy, by monitoring that address, will know exactly how your performance have been and how much money you have made.
> 
> 2. Xpub: By providing your Xpub to a pool they will be able to generate a new address of your wallet every time they send you a payout. But they will be able to track all your activities across any network (coin) in the past and in the future.
> 
> 3. PayNym: This method is known to fulfill privacy between two parties without giving access to an external party to track them. In this method you provide the pool with a payment code which will be used to generate a new address every time they send you a payout. The pool won't be able to track any other transactions/addresses outside the scope of your relationship and that is why it is considered the best practice.

On July 21st, they shared that they had "[acheived 20% adoption [among] our users and have paid hundreds of payouts to PayNym addresses](https://twitter.com/LincoinPool/status/1550178395891200000)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#march-28th---silent-payments), I included [Somsen](https://twitter.com/SomsenRuben/status/1529020377929850882)'s proposal for [Silent Payments](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8). On May 24th, 'w0xlt' [published](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-May/020513.html) a [tutorial](https://gist.github.com/w0xlt/72390ded95dd797594f80baba5d2e6ee) for testing this new scheme on [signet](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/signet/); they have also created [a test library](https://github.com/w0xlt/reusable-taproot-addresses) for the [reusable Taproot addresses](https://gist.github.com/Kixunil/0ddb3a9cdec33342b97431e438252c0a) ([TMIBP18](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2022/#february-22nd---sparrow-wallet-supports-paynyms)). If you would like a breakdown of "the mechanics of Taproot," check out this recent [demonstration](https://blog.bitmex.com/taproot-demonstration/) by [BitMEX Research](https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1539890663847862273).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

:information_source: Check out [Seth](https://twitter.com/sethforprivacy/status/1535327935682461698)'s list of "[Bitcoin proposals and ideas to improve privacy that are still a work in progress, were abandoned or never implemented, or failed to make a noticeable impact](https://sethforprivacy.com/posts/proposed-bitcoin-privacy-improvements/)."

#### June 2nd - CBDCS IN MAJOR MARKET ECONOMIES

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-27th---chimeras-of-central-bank-digital-currency), [TMIBP12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-13th---financial-freedom-and-privacy), [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-4th---the-freedom-of-bitcoin), and [TMIBP17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-9th---a-future-under-central-bank-digital-currency), I have followed exploration, promotion, and criticism of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In the last [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-14th---cbdcs-in-emerging-market-economies), I cited a [research paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf) from the [U.S. Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) on the subject, which has since received [over 1,500 public comments](https://www.federalreserve.gov/cbdc-public-comments.htm). On June 2nd, [Nicholas Anthony](https://twitter.com/EconWithNick/status/1532425508125913088), a policy analyst for the [**Cato Institute**](https://www.cato.org/people/nicholas-anthony)'s [Center for Monetary & Financial Alternatives](https://www.cato.org/centers/center-monetary-financial-alternatives) (CMFA), reported that "[76% of commenters ... oppose the idea of a CBDC](https://www.cato.org/blog/72-commenters-concerned-about-cbdc)," and showcased a selection of responses concerned with financial privacy.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Out of all the concerns, the American Civil Liberty Union (ACLU) may have taken the most concise stance when [it wrote](https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-and-partners-tell-federal-reserve-digital-cash-anonymity-not-negotiable), “Anonymity is not negotiable when it comes to digital cash.”

On June 15th, the international affairs think-tank [Atlantic Council](https://twitter.com/AtlanticCouncil/status/1556626535582515200)'s report "[Missing Key: The Challenge of Cybersecurity and Central Bank Digital Currency](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/missing-key/)" included several "principles for future legislation and regulation," and the second principle is that "privacy can strengthen security."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> ... privacy-preserving CBDC designs may also be more secure because they reduce the risk and potential harmful consequences of cyberattacks associated with data exfiltration, for example. CBDCs with stronger privacy rules may generate and store less sensitive data in the first place. In turn, potential attackers have a smaller incentive to infiltrate the system. If an attack is successful, the impact would be less severe. Our research also shows that CBDCs can offer cash-like privacy while potentially providing more efficient oversight options to regulatory authorities. To build a CBDC, policy makers in the US Congress and their colleagues around the world should carefully examine the relationship between privacy and security. They should weigh the findings of this report before making foundational decisions about a CBDC’s level of privacy that will filter through to the digital currency’s design and determine its cybersecurity profile.

They regard controls "about which personnel can search repositories of CBDC data" as a necessary feature, particuarly because "other government databases have experienced problems when a rogue government employee has complete discretion to perform universal search queries across millions of sensitive records, for example, about a former spouse, an ex-girlfriend, or fellow employee." In July, **Politico** technology reporter [Vincent Manancourt]([https://twitter.com/vmanancourt](https://twitter.com/vmanancourt/status/1545322988236578818)) would write about [the Eve Doherty case](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/garda-who-spied-on-herboyfriend-will-keep-job-rs0nsqcxprn) [in Ireland](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30800352.html) (the 'rogue' [got to keep her job](https://www.digitalrights.ie/garda-who-abused-phone-records-to-spy-on-ex-will-not-be-prosecuted-will-keep-job/)), in the context of [mass surveillance and data retention regimes thriving despite rulings by the European Court of Justice](https://www.politico.eu/article/data-retention-europe-mass-surveillance/).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On June 22nd, [Congressman Jim Himes](https://himes.house.gov/press-releases?ID=68F8CD52-0825-4902-AFDF-39443C7A1D4D) announced [a proposal](https://himes.house.gov/u-s-central-bank-digital-currency) for a Federal Reserve-issued CBDC, with a "critical role in preserving the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency of choice." In the [sections](https://himes.house.gov/_cache/files/3/d/3da9ff6d-4e8a-47b7-be28-ced21ecb5724/2F46398524B2AD91FD40BDC5263F4F23.himes-cbdc-white-paper.pdf) on 'Privacy' and 'Domestic and National Security', Himes asserts that there should be a "careful alignment of expected privacy and anonymity, along with strong financial crime enforcement," especially the Bank Secrecy Act.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> To achieve these goals, the Fed should experiment with a wide range of encryption proofs and privacy solutions that safeguard consumer data and collect only the information necessary to validate transactions. The Fed and other financial regulators should consider testing methods that shield identities and transaction amounts and prevent the aggregation of consumers’ financial history without proper legal justification. The Fed should undertake this consideration with significant public participation, education, and outreach to ensure that consumers and market participants are made aware of testing results and understand how a CBDC is and is not comparable to physical cash. Regulators and Fed officials should examine the possibility of making CBDC test design structures open source to allow academics, computer scientists, and privacy advocates to confirm the software’s efficacy and legitimacy. Congress should implement strict notification requirements so that officials tasked with oversight and civil liberties enforcement are regularly informed of CBDC privacy violations and operational risks.
> 
> .. Security standards and best practices for a U.S. CBDC should be consistent with the goals of the Bank Secrecy Act, particularly with regard to documentation, record‐keeping, employee training, audit cooperation, and internal policies. Because a CBDC should be difficult to use for illegal activities, it will require substantial oversight, done under the auspices of strict confidentiality. Intermediaries must be required to make similar efforts to monitor CBDC funds as is currently required to monitor commercial bank money, such as currency transaction reports and suspicious activity reports.

On June 26th, the [**Bank for International Settlements**](https://www.bis.org/about/areport/index.htm) (BIS) published their [annual report](https://www.bis.org/about/areport/areport2022.pdf) on "the progress we have made to support central banks’ pursuit of monetary and financial stability." It emphasizes that "CBDCs, grounded on trust in the central bank, offer the unique advantages of central bank money to the general public. CBDCs should be based on digital identification, with institutional and technological safeguards to ensure privacy."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In August, the [**European Central Bank**](https://twitter.com/ecb/status/1554408547303186434) published a working paper by Ulrich Bindseil and George Pantelopoulos titled "[Towards the Holy Grail of Cross-Border Payments](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2693~8d4e580438.en.pdf?972bbc119868c193467dc86f4a7cf706)." Under the "potential drawbacks of stablecoins," they include "market power and network effects."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> A successful global stablecoin which would perform well in terms of universal reach would have significant market power across international borders, presumably giving it leeway to eventually exploit this market power in one way or another. BigTechs could also store, use and sell payments data, raising privacy concerns.

The fundamental question that I have, and which [I asked](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/1539552848886759425) [during our panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd6jXAeNPAM) at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/oslo-freedom-forum-2022/) in May, is: would any of these CBDCs pass the WikiLeaks test? Could a journalistic publishing organisation protect their freedom of speech from extra-judicial censorship through financial blacklisting by nation states, if digital currency infrastructure was even more under the thumb of those same states? Since [June 2011](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/80774521350668288), WikiLeaks has been able to do just that with bitcoin, despite fear that doing so would bring too much attention on the nascent currency in its infancy. I suspect that the answer will be "no," and I for one [have no patience left](https://taibbi.substack.com/p/paypals-indymedia-wipeout) for "no."

#### June 11th - COIN CENTER CHALLENGES TREASURY

> Why is that review of BSA constitutionality relevant to our discussion of §6050I? Because §6050I reports are also deputized surveillance **but there is no third party**. One person to a two person transaction is obligated to collect a load of sensitive information from her counterparty and hand that to government officials without any warrant or reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing.
>
> ... An obvious question remains: why does the third-party doctrine described in the BSA cases apply when there literally are only two parties involved? Why is it constitutional for the police to force one American to collect information from their fellow citizen when they could not collect that information themselves directly without a warrant?

[**Coin Center**](https://twitter.com/coincenter/status/1546987272230297600) [announced](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1535435629974147073) that they have filed a complaint "[in federal district court against the Treasury Department in a facial constitutional challenge to the amendment of Section 6050I of the Tax Code that was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed last summer](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-has-filed-a-court-challenge-against-the-treasury-dept-over-unconstitutional-financial-surveillance/)," which is scheduled to take effect on January 1st, 2024. If you are unfamiliar with Section 6050I and how it will "likewise discourage the use of digital assets and encourage the use of banks and financial institutions," read [adjunct professor](https://www.law.virginia.edu/faculty/adjunct-profile/jas4qe/2459391) [Abraham Sutherland](https://twitter.com/abesutherland)'s [piece on it](https://www.coincenter.org/congress-takes-its-war-on-cash-to-digital-assets/) from last year:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Today, when you file an IRS Form 8300, you’re also filing a FinCEN Form 8300 that’s governed by BSA rules. It’s literally the same form. But FinCEN — the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, another part of the Treasury Department — can use it in ways the IRS cannot.
>
> So, when the local chief of police or a foreign government wants to know more about your suspected history of lavish cash spending, they don’t have to deal with IRS rigmarole on confidentiality and privacy. Instead, they go to FinCEN and request all the FinCEN Forms 8300 where you’re named in connection with large cash transactions.
>
> But there’s a new twist. Congress just amended 26 USC section 6050I to include digital assets. But it did not also amend 31 USC section 5331.
>
> So, the Internal Revenue Code mandates digital asset reporting (under section 6050I, the authorization for IRS Form 8300), while the Bank Secrecy Act (under section 5331, the authorization for FinCEN Form 8300) does not.
> 
> ... note how the requirement will encourage the use of banks and other “financial institutions” that are regulated under the Bank Secrecy Act. Transactions handled by financial institutions are generally exempt from 6050I reporting, and these financial institutions take care of all the reporting required under the BSA. This includes banks handling dollars, of course, but it also includes “money transmitters” such as Coinbase that handle Bitcoin and other digital assets.

[**Coin Center**](https://www.coincenter.org/people/peter-van-valkenburgh/)'s director of research [Peter van Valkenburgh](https://twitter.com/valkenburgh) had written in September 2021 about why "[the §6050I reporting provision is a draconian surveillance rule that should have been ruled unconstitutional long ago](https://www.coincenter.org/an-unworkable-and-arguably-unconstitutional-tax-change-tucked-away-in-the-infrastructure-bill/)," and therefore "it will be ripe for a constitutional challenge and Coin Center is prepared to take on that challenge." With two "co-plaintiffs in this case, Dan Carman, a consultant who helps set up businesses to use Bitcoin, and Raymond Walsh, a Bitcoin entrepreneur, along with his mining company Quiet Industries," their [complaint](https://www.coincenter.org/app/uploads/2022/06/1-Complaint.pdf) concerns violations of the First (pg. 49-58), Fourth (pg. 41-49), and Fifth (pg. 58-65, 68-69) Amendments, as well as "recent Supreme Court jurisprudence." They happened to file it on the same day that Treasury deputy secretary [Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/Wally-Adeyemo) spoke at **CoinDesk**'s Consensus 2022 event, regarding "[how the Treasury Department is approaching the digital assets landscape, and the role of regulation in promoting the kind of innovation we need to maintain U.S. leadership of the global financial system](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0814)."

On June 13th, [Anthony](https://twitter.com/EconWithNick) reported via the [**Cato Institute**](https://twitter.com/CatoInstitute/status/1542919220828184576) about the case and noted that this "[will open the door for additional long‐needed changes to strengthen Americans’ constitutional protections](https://www.cato.org/blog/cryptocurrency-shadow-infrastructure-act-update)." He had also recently [warned](https://twitter.com/CatoCMFA/status/1539300376817676288) that this financial surveillance has not been adjusting for inflation: "[The $10,000 threshold was set 50 years ago. If it were adjusted for inflation all this time, the threshold would be nearly $75,000 today](https://www.cato.org/blog/how-inflation-erodes-financial-privacy)." [Norbert Michel](https://twitter.com/norbertjmichel), [vice president and director](https://www.cato.org/people/norbert-michel) of their [Center for Monetary & Financial Alternatives](https://www.cato.org/centers/center-monetary-financial-alternatives) (CMFA), had [written](https://twitter.com/CatoCMFA/status/1520014547968573443) back in April that "[two current Supreme Court Justices have signaled a willingness to revisit some of the constitutional questions raised by the Court in the early 1970s](https://www.cato.org/commentary/fincen-needs-more-oversight-congress-needs-fix-bank-secrecy-act#)." Michel and co-author [Jennifer J. Schulp](https://twitter.com/jenniferjschulp/status/1529929667372888064) had just released [a working paper](https://www.alt-m.org/2022/04/14/revising-the-bank-secrecy-act-to-protect-privacy-and-deter-criminals-cmfa-working-paper-no-007/) on the subject, "[Revising the Bank Secrecy Act to Protect Privacy and Deter Criminals](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/revising-bank-secrecy-act-protect-privacy-deter-criminals)." The final version was published on July 26th.

> Although it’s unfortunate that this surveillance has survived for so long, it’s good that it’s being thrust into the spotlight now. The Supreme Court did not hold that the BSA violated citizens’ rights to financial privacy [in the 1970s](https://www.cato.org/blog/why-dont-americans-have-stronger-financial-privacy-rights), but the Justices did recognize that technological change could easily mean that the BSA would violate those rights. And today’s financial world is much different, a fact [acknowledged by current Supreme Court Justices Gorsuch and Sotomayor](https://www.alt-m.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RevisingTheBankSecrecyAct_NorbertMichelAndJenniferSchulp_CMFAWP007.pdf).

In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-15th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule), and [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-9th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs-update), I have followed [Jim Harper](https://twitter.com/Jim_Harper/status/1393581639670829057)'s [lawsuit](https://nclalegal.org/james-harper-v-charles-p-rettig-et-al/) against the IRS "for violation of my Fourth Amendment and Due Process rights" in relation to the sharing of his financial data by a third-party service, Coinbase. In December 2021, [Harper](https://twitter.com/Jim_Harper/status/1468780778817523718)'s case went before "[a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston [which] sharply questioned why, under a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, cryptocurrency expert Jim Harper was barred from pursuing his lawsuit accusing the IRS of violating his privacy rights](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/cryptocurrency-expert-tells-court-irs-fishing-expedition-violates-privacy-rights-2021-12-08/)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [U.S. Justice Department attorney Kathleen] Lyon warned that a ruling against the IRS could open the floodgate to other lawsuits by taxpayers under audit. "There's nothing to keep that from happening," she said.

In August 2021, [Harper](https://twitter.com/Jim_Harper/status/1422957672496775175) had also [commented on the Infrastructure Bill](https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/infrastructure-bill-action-could-doom-us-cryptocurrency-industry/):
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> I cited the privacy and security risks of having all this data go to the IRS. I think one can put a sharper point on it by saying that the benefit of increased tax compliance is speculative and uncertain, while the cost in risk to taxpayers is fairly certain. If the IRS were to produce its tax-compliance research, perhaps it could validate collecting all this information. Until we know more, this is not a tax compliance rule, but a data collection rule with an unknown relationship to tax compliance.

On May 4th 2022, [Harper](https://www.aei.org/research-products/testimony/testimony-privacy-and-other-challenges-for-mandated-internet-platform-disclosure/) testified before the [U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/platform-transparency-understanding-the-impact-of-social-media) on "[Privacy and Other Challenges for Mandated Internet Platform Disclosure](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Harper%20Testimony.pdf)," where he outlines "eight distinct values" for the word 'privacy' and how most people care about them:

> In survey research I recently published,[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/what-do-people-mean-by-privacy-and-how-do-they-prioritize-among-privacy-values-preliminary-results/) I found that financial security (i.e., prevention of identity fraud) is foremost in people’s minds when asked an open-ended question about privacy concerns. When prompted to address the eight values listed above, financial security remains a top priority, joined by personal security, reputation, and autonomy. Lower-tier values, in descending order, are control, fairness, peace and quiet, and anti-commercialism.
> 
> ... I will focus here on what I believe to be the strongest sense of the word “privacy”: control of information about oneself. A legalistic definition of privacy in the control sense that I worked up some years ago has held up fairly well. Privacy is “the subjective condition that people experience when they have power to control information about themselves and when they exercise that power consistent with their interests and values.”[<sup>4</sup>](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/understanding-privacy-real-threats-it) We all hide and share information about ourselves to portray ourselves as we wish to be perceived by others. Most people do so inarticulately, following social customs and the occasional lessons of trial and error.
> 
> Importantly, privacy is subjective. Each person chooses what to share and what not to share (again, inarticulately) based on their own interests, values, customs, and so on. Overriding their choices deprives them of control and thus privacy.

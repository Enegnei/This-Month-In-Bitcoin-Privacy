> "[From Pat Barker's Regeneration (1991):] 'Cut a chrysalis open, and you will find a rotting caterpillar. What you will never find is that mythical creature, half caterpillar, half butterfly, a fit emblem of the human soul, for those whose cast of mind leads them to seek such emblems. No, the process of transformation consists almost entirely of decay.' But the butterfly is so fit an emblem of the human soul that its name in Greek is *psyche*, the word for soul. We have not much language to appreciate this phase of decay, this withdrawal, this era of ending that must precede beginning. Nor of the violence of the metamorphosis, which is often spoken of as though it were as graceful as a flower blooming."*

> "The most radical and the only secure form of possession is destruction, for only what we have destroyed is safely and forever ours."
>
> ― Hannah Arendt, "The Origins of Totalitarianism"

> "... sometimes the poetry of destruction is the only art form left to them."
> 
> ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, "Children of Ruin" (2019)

> "Happened stories are all alike, every unhappened story is unhappened in its own way... Can the past be resurrected or re-member-ed again? Should it be? And how much past can a person bear?"

This moth, whose homeland is history, flutters ahead through a pitch-black hollow, alighting momentarily upon pillars of streaming, cascading electronic waves. Reflecting a rainbow of pixelated droplets, the moth's eyespots seem to wink at you. Wings shedding soft scraps of paper after each landing, papers artfully burned around the edges like a lining of mascara. Too many for one person to catch or to hold, let alone read. Stalagmites grow slowly in the wake of your pursuit, where the meandering waters of light may someday lap at a new edge of darkness. Choose your pillars wisely...

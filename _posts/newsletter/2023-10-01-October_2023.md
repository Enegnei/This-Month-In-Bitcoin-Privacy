What you will never find is that mythical creature, half caterpillar, half butterfly, a fit emblem of the human soul, for those whose cast of mind leads them to seek such emblems. No, the process of transformation consists almost entirely of decay.' But the butterfly is so fit an emblem of the human soul that its name in Greek is *psyche*, the word for soul. We have not much language to appreciate this phase of decay, this withdrawal, this era of ending that must precede beginning. Nor of the violence of the metamorphosis, which is often spoken of as though it were as graceful as a flower blooming."

This moth, whose homeland is history, flutters ahead through a pitch-black hollow, alighting momentarily upon pillars of streaming, cascading electronic waves. Reflecting a rainbow of pixelated droplets, the moth's eyespots seem to wink at you. Particular columns of radiant data lure the tiny creature more than others. After each brief landing, the wings pulse and shed soft scraps of paper artfully burned around the edges like a lining of mascara. Too many for one person to catch or to hold, let alone read. Stalagmites grow slowly in the wake of your pursuit, where the meandering waters of digital light may someday lap at a new edge of darkness. Choose your pillars wisely...

## LEDGER RECOVER SERVICE

On May 16th 2023, hardware wallet maker [**Ledger**](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1658458714771169282) had announced the approaching launch of "an optional paid subscription service" for Nano X users called '[Recover](https://www.ledger.com/recover).' If enabled, the user would first submit some form of identification to Ledger's partner, [Coincover](https://www.coincover.com/about), a U.K.-based "crypto insurance platform" founded in 2018. Once the identity verification process is complete, the user's Ledger device will then "duplicate, encrypt and fragment your private key into three parts [using Shamir Secret Sharing] within the Secure Element chip... These encrypted fragments are securely sent to three independent providers – Ledger, Coincover, and EscrowTech that will store them in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Since the announcement, Ledger and Coincover have jointly published six detailed articles on how '[Recover](https://www.coincover.com/blog/tag/ledger-recover)' will work. The [fourth](https://www.ledger.com/blog/part-4-genesis-of-ledger-recover-controlling-access-to-the-backup-identity-verification) [post](https://www.coincover.com/blog/part-4-genesis-of-ledger-recover-controlling-access-to-the-backup-identity-verification), released on September 7th, focuses on the identity verification (IDV) step, which involves a combination of providing a government-issued identification document and passing a "biometric test" / comparison with a live selfie and video. Ledger is also a 'backup provider' and "relies on Tessi services to validate your identity when you request a restore." [Tessi](https://www.tessi.eu/en/about-us/) is a "Business Process Services partner" offering 'solutions' in [digital identities](https://www.tessi.eu/en/solution/technologies/software-publishing/securite-confiance-numerique/digital-identity/) and [know-your-customer](https://www.tessi.eu/en/solution/services/business-back-office/partiel-delegated-management/know-your-customer-and-fighting-fraud/) (KYC), among other things.

> [**What is the difference between Ledger Recover identity verification and KYC?**](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/9579368109597-Ledger-Recover-FAQs?docs=true) Identity verification is not the same as KYC. Identity verification inherently collects much less information compared to KYC. To go through Ledger Recover identity verification you need a valid, government-issued document and be the rightful owner of that document. KYC involves ID verification but it can also include revenue information, record of criminal activity, citizenship check, etc. Again, Ledger Recover uses identity verification, not KYC.

While Ledger claims these operations are "not KYC", it is still rather clear how [the 'IDV' acronym](https://www.kinectify.com/resources/id-verification-vs-kyc-whats-the-difference) [originates from](https://www.castellum.ai/insights/aml-kyc-data-for-identity-verification), and that these services support, efforts to introduce digitized and often more intrusive KYC requirements in response to anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. For example, **Plaid**, the financial technology company that faced class action lawsuits and anti-trust complaints ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-1st---class-action-lawsuit-against-plaid-inc), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-17th---how-private-is-my-pay-app), [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#may-12th---plaid-class-action-lawsuit-update)), offers [identity verification](https://plaid.com/products/identity-verification/) and explicitly includes 'IDV' as part of their [AML screening process](https://plaid.com/docs/identity-verification/#aml-screening). Should you fail the first two IDVs with Ledger 'Recover', then a third manual IDV can be performed through Coincover, but involving "another independent service provider IDNow," a [identity verification](https://www.idnow.io/platform/), [screening and compliance](https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/) platform. Ledger says that "in accordance with our data retention policy, your IDV data is securely retained until you unsubscribe from the service and then archived in a database with strict limited access for litigation purposes only." Their [privacy policy](https://www.ledger.com/recover/privacy-policy) states that this retention period is at least 7 years.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The issue is that the code which instructs the device to export the keys is part of the new OS, without an opt-in system. The Ledger Recover system introduces the possibility of third party risk that didn’t exist before. You can opt-in to using the service, but you cannot opt-in to having that function installed on your device unless you choose not to update, which ultimately can cause problems on devices because updates are used to push security and functionality updates.
> 
> ― "[Ledger Recover Saga](https://archive.ph/kbiyt)" by [Pamela Morgan](https://empoweredlaw.com/about/about-pm/)

[Blockchain Commons](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/home/) founder and executive director [Christopher Allen](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/about/) commented that the crux of the controversy was "[in large part because we didn't expect seeds to ever leave the Ledger device](https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1659031686297042944)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> As it turns out (as all hardware wallet designers already know), all it requires is a signed firmware update, and seeds can go wherever they want. Why? The problem is that no existing SE chips can do secp256k1 (the curve used by Bitcoin & Ethereum) natively and safely in semiconductor logic. This isn't an issue with Ledger; it's an issue with all current chips used by wallets today. This means that in order to do secp256k1, a SE has to hand a key off to a code execution process in the SE or to an MPU. That's what opens the doors for doing unexpected things with that key — things that most didn't expect from a personal hardware wallet.
> 
> In other words, the public might have had the expectation that keys weren't going to ever leave the Ledger, but that expectation is actually impossible to support today, because keys already have to leave the most trusted part of the Secure Enclave to be used!

On October 19th, CEO [Pascal Gauthier](https://www.ledger.com/people/pascal-gauthier) began "[the countdown for our launch](https://twitter.com/_pgauthier/status/1714908534284960238)" and shared the published code for '[Recover](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-os/blob/main/dashboard/src/dashboard_recover.c)' (the majority of their operating system remains closed-source). On October 24th, they [announced](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1716767739782574368) that it was "[now available for Ledger Nano X users](https://twitter.com/_pgauthier/status/1716768601854628087)," though only those with a national identity based in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. According to the dedicated page, 'Recover' costs "9,99€ per month after the first free month." Why such a not-KYC process should require government identification, and not possibly work with various alternative forms of identity or web-of-trust proofs, is a question left to the reader:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Ledger Recover availability depends on the country in which your passport, national identity card, or driving license was issued. At the moment, a passport/national identity card issued by the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, or a driving license issued in the United States, is required to subscribe to the service. We will be covering more countries and adding support for more documents. Stay tuned.

## FINCEN PROPOSED RULEMAKING ON MIXING

> In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-20th---how-i-knew-your-customer-fatf-compliance) and [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule), I covered the development of an inter-VASP customer data sharing system for compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Travel Rule, and how FinCEN was seeking to lower the threshold [of reportable activity] (a proposal for which they received "roughly 2,900 comments"); in [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-15th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-2nd---eff-calls-for-coinbase-transparency) and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-17th---how-private-is-my-pay-app), I've followed challenges to the use of the third-party doctrine regarding financial records; in [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), I also highlighted how the effectiveness of anti-money laundering policies came under scrutiny with the release of the '[FinCEN Files](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/)', and interest in identifying '[crypto-exposed persons](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-19th---chainalysis-and-crypto-exposed-persons).'

> ― TMIBP07, "THE PATRIOT ACT: SHARE IT ALL" (December 2020)

In [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-20th---fincen-proposed-rulemaking-suspended), and [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-1st---fincen-proposed-rulemaking-update), I followed an attempt by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury, "[to require banks and money service businesses (‘MSBs’) to submit reports, keep records, and verify the identity of customers in relation to transactions involving convertible virtual currency (‘CVC’) or digital assets with legal tender status (‘legal tender digital assets’ or ‘LTDA’) held in unhosted wallets](https://web.archive.org/web/20201218212406/https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28437.pdf)." This [notice of proposed rulemaking](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FINCEN-2020-0020) (NPRM) was ultimately suspended in January 2021, but FinCEN continues to justify increasing reporting requirements under the [USA PATRIOT Act of 2001](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/usa-patriot-act).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On October 19th, FinCEN announced [a new NPRM](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/23/2023-23449/proposal-of-special-measure-regarding-convertible-virtual-currency-mixing-as-a-class-of-transactions) that would "[require covered financial institutions to report information about a transaction when they know, suspect, or have reason to suspect it involves [Convertible Virtual Currency] CVC mixing within or involving jurisdictions outside the United States](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-proposes-new-regulation-enhance-transparency-convertible-virtual-currency)," with the stated goal of "increas[ing] transparency around CVC mixing to combat its use by malicious actors including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)." They argue that mixing is "a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern," which under the PATRIOT Act gives the Secretary of the Treasury power to "prohibit, or impose conditions upon, the opening or maintaining in the United States of correspondent or payable-through accounts for or on behalf of a foreign banking institution." They cite the [Bitcoin Fog](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-23449/p-113) case ([TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#august-3rd---the-fog-of-analysis), [TMIBP22](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2023/#april-25th---the-fog-of-analysis-continued)), and OFAC's designation of Ethereum-based mixer Tornado Cash as a sanctioned entity ([TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#august-8th---ofac-sanctions-tornado-cash), [TMIBP21](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2022/#november-22nd---tornado-cash-update), [TMIBP22](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2023/#april-26th---tornado-cash-update-continued)) as a successful prior action. They claim that "this additional transparancy would serve two purposes," namely "support[ing] money laundering investigations" against any "threat to U.S national security and the U.S. financial system," and "deter illicit actors' use of CVC mixing services... to facilitate WMD proliferation, ransomware attackers' laundering of ransoms, and obfuscation of transactions associated with the use of illicit darknet markets."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> FinCEN recognizes that there are legitimate reasons why responsible actors might want to conduct financial transactions in a secure and private manner given the amount of information available on public blockchains. FinCEN also recognizes that, in addition to illicit purposes, CVC mixing may be used for legitimate purposes, such as privacy enhancement for those who live under repressive regimes or wish to conduct licit transactions anonymously.[<sup>70</sup>](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-23449/p-123) Still, CVC mixing presents an acute money laundering risk because it shields information from responsible third parties, such as financial institutions and law enforcement.
> 
> ... Thus, the legitimate applications of CVC mixing must be carefully weighed against the exposure of the U.S. financial system to ongoing illicit use of CVC mixing. Given the substantial risks posed by CVC mixing, the fact that CVC mixing can be used for some legitimate business purposes does not alter FinCEN's conclusion that this class of transactions is of primary money laundering concern.

The proposal does not itself mention specific mixing tools beyond the services that have already been sanctioned or shut down, and unlike prior reports ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-4th---europol-cybercrime-report-on-wasabi-wallet), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-5th---europol-cybercrime-on-wasabi-and-samourai), [TMIBP22](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2023/#december-14th---digital-asset-anti-money-laundering-act-of-2022)) from both themselves and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), they do not include the distinction between mixing "service providers" and "software providers" in their definition of a "CVC mixer."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [The term “CVC mixer” means any person, group, service, code, tool, or function that facilitates CVC mixing. FinCEN acknowledges this definition is relatively broad; however, given the nature of CVC mixing, FinCEN deems the breadth of this definition to be necessary.](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-23449/p-151)

The [reportable information](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-23449/p-172) to be required from covered institutions, "within 30 calendar days of initial detection of a covered transaction," includes: *the amount of any CVC transferred, in both CVC and its U.S. dollar equivalent when the transaction was initiated; CVC type; the CVC mixer used, if known; CVC wallet address associated with the mixer; CVC wallet address associated with the customer; transaction hash; date of transaction; IP addresses and time stamps associated with the covered transaction; narrative* (e.g. "a description of activity observed by the covered financial institution, including a summary of investigative steps taken, ... [and] if there is an uncharacteristic change in pattern of behavior"); *the customer's full name, date of birth, residential or business address, email address, and unique identifying number* (such as an IRS TIN or foreign equivalent, passport number or other government-issued photo identification number, such as a driver's license).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In relation to Hamas and the recent escalation in Gaza, it is also important to note that blockchain surveillance tools have been misused to support greatly exaggerated claims about bitcoin and other crypto-assets being used to support violence and terrorism. On October 10th, **Wall Street Journal** (WSJ) global finance reporters [Angus Berwick](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/angus-berwick) and [Ian Talley](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/ian-talley) cited **Elliptic** as a source for their assertion that "[digital-currency wallets that Israeli authorities linked to the PIJ received as much as $93 million in crypto between August 2021 and June this year](https://archive.ph/e4m88)." Specifically, they conclude the article by naming "[Matthew Price, a former IRS investigator who now leads Elliptic’s business working with law enforcement](https://archive.ph/e4m88#selection-4955.0-4955.180)." As I pointed out in the last [TMIBP22](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2023/#april-25th---the-fog-of-analysis-continued), Price was previously 'Global Head of Intelligence and Investigations' at **Binance** and one of the two main IRS-CI special agents behind the allegations against Sterlingov in the Bitcoin Fog case, “after a stint at the CIA.” [**Elliptic**](https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1717245156007522371) and [**Chainalysis**](https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1714748704702296457), blockchain surveillance companies which both have [prior](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_20341219P00013_2036_-NONE-_-NONE-) and/or [currently active service contracts](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_20341223P00005_2036_-NONE-_-NONE-) with the Treasury Department and FinCEN specifically, have issued corrections on the matter:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [**ELLIPTIC**](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/setting-the-record-straight-on-crypto-crowdfunding-by-hamas): Over the past two weeks, politicians and journalists have portrayed public crypto fundraising as a significant source of funds for Hamas and other terrorist groups, but the data simply does not support this. No public crypto fundraising campaign by a terrorist group has received significant levels of donations, relative to other funding sources.
> 
> ... there is no evidence to suggest that crypto fundraising has raised anything close to this amount, and data provided by Elliptic and others has been misinterpreted. We have spoken to representatives of the lead signatory, Senator Warren, as well as the authors of the Wall Street Journal article, to clarify this.
>
> [**CHAINALYSIS**](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-terrorism-financing-accuracy-check/): ... we have also seen overstated metrics and flawed analyses of these terrorist groups’ use of cryptocurrency, and feel compelled to address some misconceptions.

However, the language of these corrections obscures their own glaring culpability. The **Elliptic** source, though not cited directly in the WSJ piece, was likely none other than "[Israel Orders Seizure of Crypto Wallets Worth $94 Million Linked to Palestinian Islamic Jihad](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/analysis/israel-orders-seizure-of-crypto-wallets-worth-94-million-linked-to-palestinian-islamic-jihad)," originally published by "Senior Crypto Threat Analyst" Eray Arda Akartuna on July 6th 2023. Akartuna is a [PhD researcher](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/future-crime/phd-research) at the [Dawes Centre for Future Crime](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/future-crime/) at UCL, under the topic of "money laundering and terrorist financing future directions" and with input to "detection and mitigation of financial fraud in the cryptocurrency space." In 2021, Akartuna was a research assistant on "[cryptocurrency fraud](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/future-crime/publications/2021/may/cryptocurrency-fraud-future-challenge-large-scale-financial-crime)," with a [policy brief document](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/future-crime/policy-briefs/policy-brief-cryptocurrencies-and-future-crime) that mentions how "[law enforcement agencies are able to use a variety of new forensic techniques and tools to analyse illicit flows of Bitcoin](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/future-crime/sites/future_crime/files/ucl_cryptocurrencies_and_future_crime_policy_briefing_feb2021_compressed_1.pdf)." According to [his LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/eaakartuna), between June 2022 and January 2023, Akartuna was involved in [a joint project](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/future-crime/publications/2022/jun/cryptocurrency-and-money-laundering) between UCL and the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) (ANU) "to scope the future of money laundering and terrorist financing through cryptoassets."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

As of at least [October 11th](https://web.archive.org/web/20231011192204/https://www.elliptic.co/blog/analysis/israel-orders-seizure-of-crypto-wallets-worth-94-million-linked-to-palestinian-islamic-jihad), the day after the publication of the WSJ article, the included chart was titled "Number and Value of Crypto Transactions *Received by* Palestinian Islamic Jihad." Yet the chart's new and current title, as of [October 25th](https://web.archive.org/web/20231025182853/https://www.elliptic.co/blog/analysis/israel-orders-seizure-of-crypto-wallets-worth-94-million-linked-to-palestinian-islamic-jihad) at the latest, is "Number and Value of Crypto Transactions *Received by Wallets Linked to* Palestinian Islamic Jihad *by the NBCTF*" (the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel). The WSJ article was then [subsequently updated on October 27th](https://archive.ph/M9Ntd) with qualifications in various places, including "Elliptic says it isn’t clear if all of the transactions it identified directly involved PIJ" and "it couldn’t be determined whether the crypto they received was directly used to finance the assault." However, this was more than ten days too late, as [Senator Elizabeth Warren](https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1714739689788235847) ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-2nd---tax-authorities-demand-disclosures)) had [amplified the original copy](https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1712132781277335844), published [a WSJ](https://twitter.com/WSJopinion/status/1714833761659912197) [opinion piece](https://archive.ph/1rfHB) with the inflated numbers to promote their own Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act ([TMIBP22](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2023/#december-14th---digital-asset-anti-money-laundering-act-of-2022)), and used all this to support [a bipartisan](https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-marshall-casten-100-lawmakers-ask-biden-administration-to-address-crypto-financed-terrorism-after-reports-of-hamas-raising-millions-in-crypto-to-fund-operations) [letter](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023.10.17%20Letter%20to%20Treasury%20and%20White%20House%20re%20Hamas%20crypto%20security.pdf?ref=observers.com) to Treasury Under-Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence [Brian E. Nelson](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/Brian-Nelson) and White House national security advisor [Jake Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan), demanding to be informed of the "Treasury’s plans to address the serious national security threats posed by the use of cryptocurrency to finance terrorism no later than October 31, 2023."

> Blindly trusting the results of blockchain analytics platform is the recipe for a disaster waiting to happen. And the result of this collective laissez-faire is that we have now a blockchain analytics company (Chainalysis) refusing to let a man access elements that would allow him to prepare his defense. The impunity that was collectively granted to these companies for years is pure insanity and it's our collective duty to fix the situation.

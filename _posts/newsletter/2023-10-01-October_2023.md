> "[From Pat Barker's Regeneration (1991):] 'Cut a chrysalis open, and you will find a rotting caterpillar. What you will never find is that mythical creature, half caterpillar, half butterfly, a fit emblem of the human soul, for those whose cast of mind leads them to seek such emblems. No, the process of transformation consists almost entirely of decay.' But the butterfly is so fit an emblem of the human soul that its name in Greek is *psyche*, the word for soul. We have not much language to appreciate this phase of decay, this withdrawal, this era of ending that must precede beginning. Nor of the violence of the metamorphosis, which is often spoken of as though it were as graceful as a flower blooming."

> "The most radical and the only secure form of possession is destruction, for only what we have destroyed is safely and forever ours."
>
> ― Hannah Arendt, "The Origins of Totalitarianism"

> "... sometimes the poetry of destruction is the only art form left to them."
> 
> ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, "Children of Ruin" (2019)

> "Happened stories are all alike, every unhappened story is unhappened in its own way... Can the past be resurrected or re-member-ed again? Should it be? And how much past can a person bear?"

This moth, whose homeland is history, flutters ahead through a pitch-black hollow, alighting momentarily upon pillars of streaming, cascading electronic waves. Reflecting a rainbow of pixelated droplets, the moth's eyespots seem to wink at you. Particular columns of radiant data lure the tiny creature more than others. After each brief landing, the wings pulse and shed soft scraps of paper artfully burned around the edges like a lining of mascara. Too many for one person to catch or to hold, let alone read. Stalagmites grow slowly in the wake of your pursuit, where the meandering waters of digital light may someday lap at a new edge of darkness. Choose your pillars wisely...

## LEDGER RECOVER SERVICE

On May 16th 2023, hardware wallet maker [**Ledger**](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1658458714771169282) had announced the approaching launch of "an optional paid subscription service" for Nano X users called '[Recover](https://www.ledger.com/recover).' If enabled, the user would first submit some form of identification to Ledger's partner, [Coincover](https://www.coincover.com/about), a U.K.-based "crypto insurance platform" founded in 2018. Once the identity verification process is complete, the user's Ledger device will then "duplicate, encrypt and fragment your private key into three parts [using Shamir Secret Sharing] within the Secure Element chip... These encrypted fragments are securely sent to three independent providers – Ledger, Coincover, and EscrowTech that will store them in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Since the announcement, Ledger and Coincover have jointly published six detailed articles on how '[Recover](https://www.coincover.com/blog/tag/ledger-recover)' will work. The [fourth](https://www.ledger.com/blog/part-4-genesis-of-ledger-recover-controlling-access-to-the-backup-identity-verification) [post](https://www.coincover.com/blog/part-4-genesis-of-ledger-recover-controlling-access-to-the-backup-identity-verification), released on September 7th, focuses on the identity verification (IDV) step, which involves a combination of providing a government-issued identification document and passing a "biometric test" / comparison with a live selfie and video. Ledger is also a 'backup provider' and "relies on Tessi services to validate your identity when you request a restore." [Tessi](https://www.tessi.eu/en/about-us/) is a "Business Process Services partner" offering 'solutions' in [digital identities](https://www.tessi.eu/en/solution/technologies/software-publishing/securite-confiance-numerique/digital-identity/) and [know-your-customer](https://www.tessi.eu/en/solution/services/business-back-office/partiel-delegated-management/know-your-customer-and-fighting-fraud/) (KYC), among other things. While Ledger claims that, it is rather clear that these services and the 'IDV' acronym itself originate from efforts to introduce more intrusive KYC requirements in response to anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Should you fail these two IDVs, then a third manual IDV can be performed through Coincover, but involving "another independent service provider IDNow," a [identity verification]](https://www.idnow.io/platform/), [screening and compliance](https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/) platform. Ledger says that "in accordance with our data retention policy, your IDV data is securely retained until you unsubscribe from the service and then archived in a database with strict limited access for litigation purposes only." Their [privacy policy](https://www.ledger.com/recover/privacy-policy) states that this retention period is at least 7 years.

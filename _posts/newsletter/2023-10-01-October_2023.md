What you will never find is that mythical creature, half caterpillar, half butterfly, a fit emblem of the human soul, for those whose cast of mind leads them to seek such emblems. No, the process of transformation consists almost entirely of decay.' But the butterfly is so fit an emblem of the human soul that its name in Greek is *psyche*, the word for soul. We have not much language to appreciate this phase of decay, this withdrawal, this era of ending that must precede beginning. Nor of the violence of the metamorphosis, which is often spoken of as though it were as graceful as a flower blooming."

This moth, whose homeland is history, flutters ahead through a pitch-black hollow, alighting momentarily upon pillars of streaming, cascading electronic waves. Reflecting a rainbow of pixelated droplets, the moth's eyespots seem to wink at you. Particular columns of radiant data lure the tiny creature more than others. After each brief landing, the wings pulse and shed soft scraps of paper artfully burned around the edges like a lining of mascara. Too many for one person to catch or to hold, let alone read. Stalagmites grow slowly in the wake of your pursuit, where the meandering waters of digital light may someday lap at a new edge of darkness. Choose your pillars wisely...

## LEDGER RECOVER SERVICE

On May 16th 2023, hardware wallet maker [**Ledger**](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1658458714771169282) had announced the approaching launch of "an optional paid subscription service" for Nano X users called '[Recover](https://www.ledger.com/recover).' If enabled, the user would first submit some form of identification to Ledger's partner, [Coincover](https://www.coincover.com/about), a U.K.-based "crypto insurance platform" founded in 2018. Once the identity verification process is complete, the user's Ledger device will then "duplicate, encrypt and fragment your private key into three parts [using Shamir Secret Sharing] within the Secure Element chip... These encrypted fragments are securely sent to three independent providers – Ledger, Coincover, and EscrowTech that will store them in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Since the announcement, Ledger and Coincover have jointly published six detailed articles on how '[Recover](https://www.coincover.com/blog/tag/ledger-recover)' will work. The [fourth](https://www.ledger.com/blog/part-4-genesis-of-ledger-recover-controlling-access-to-the-backup-identity-verification) [post](https://www.coincover.com/blog/part-4-genesis-of-ledger-recover-controlling-access-to-the-backup-identity-verification), released on September 7th, focuses on the identity verification (IDV) step, which involves a combination of providing a government-issued identification document and passing a "biometric test" / comparison with a live selfie and video. Ledger is also a 'backup provider' and "relies on Tessi services to validate your identity when you request a restore." [Tessi](https://www.tessi.eu/en/about-us/) is a "Business Process Services partner" offering 'solutions' in [digital identities](https://www.tessi.eu/en/solution/technologies/software-publishing/securite-confiance-numerique/digital-identity/) and [know-your-customer](https://www.tessi.eu/en/solution/services/business-back-office/partiel-delegated-management/know-your-customer-and-fighting-fraud/) (KYC), among other things.

> [**What is the difference between Ledger Recover identity verification and KYC?**](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/9579368109597-Ledger-Recover-FAQs?docs=true) Identity verification is not the same as KYC. Identity verification inherently collects much less information compared to KYC. To go through Ledger Recover identity verification you need a valid, government-issued document and be the rightful owner of that document. KYC involves ID verification but it can also include revenue information, record of criminal activity, citizenship check, etc. Again, Ledger Recover uses identity verification, not KYC.

While Ledger claims these operations are "not KYC", it is still rather clear how [the 'IDV' acronym](https://www.kinectify.com/resources/id-verification-vs-kyc-whats-the-difference) [originates from](https://www.castellum.ai/insights/aml-kyc-data-for-identity-verification), and that these services support, efforts to introduce digitized and often more intrusive KYC requirements in response to anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. For example, **Plaid**, the financial technology company that faced class action lawsuits and anti-trust complaints ([TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-1st---class-action-lawsuit-against-plaid-inc), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-17th---how-private-is-my-pay-app), [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#may-12th---plaid-class-action-lawsuit-update)), offers [identity verification](https://plaid.com/products/identity-verification/) and explicitly includes 'IDV' as part of their [AML screening process](https://plaid.com/docs/identity-verification/#aml-screening). Should you fail the first two IDVs with Ledger 'Recover', then a third manual IDV can be performed through Coincover, but involving "another independent service provider IDNow," a [identity verification](https://www.idnow.io/platform/), [screening and compliance](https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/) platform. Ledger says that "in accordance with our data retention policy, your IDV data is securely retained until you unsubscribe from the service and then archived in a database with strict limited access for litigation purposes only." Their [privacy policy](https://www.ledger.com/recover/privacy-policy) states that this retention period is at least 7 years.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The issue is that the code which instructs the device to export the keys is part of the new OS, without an opt-in system. The Ledger Recover system introduces the possibility of third party risk that didn’t exist before. You can opt-in to using the service, but you cannot opt-in to having that function installed on your device unless you choose not to update, which ultimately can cause problems on devices because updates are used to push security and functionality updates.
> 
> ― "[Ledger Recover Saga](https://archive.ph/kbiyt)" by [Pamela Morgan](https://empoweredlaw.com/about/about-pm/)

[Blockchain Commons](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/home/) founder and executive director [Christopher Allen](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/about/) commented that the crux of the controversy was "[in large part because we didn't expect seeds to ever leave the Ledger device](https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1659031686297042944)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> As it turns out (as all hardware wallet designers already know), all it requires is a signed firmware update, and seeds can go wherever they want. Why? The problem is that no existing SE chips can do secp256k1 (the curve used by Bitcoin & Ethereum) natively and safely in semiconductor logic. This isn't an issue with Ledger; it's an issue with all current chips used by wallets today. This means that in order to do secp256k1, a SE has to hand a key off to a code execution process in the SE or to an MPU. That's what opens the doors for doing unexpected things with that key — things that most didn't expect from a personal hardware wallet.
> 
> In other words, the public might have had the expectation that keys weren't going to ever leave the Ledger, but that expectation is actually impossible to support today, because keys already have to leave the most trusted part of the Secure Enclave to be used!

On October 19th, CEO [Pascal Gauthier](https://www.ledger.com/people/pascal-gauthier) began "[the countdown for our launch](https://twitter.com/_pgauthier/status/1714908534284960238)" and shared the published code for '[Recover](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-os/blob/main/dashboard/src/dashboard_recover.c)' (the majority of their operating system remains closed-source). On October 24th, they [announced](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1716767739782574368) that it was "[now available for Ledger Nano X users](https://twitter.com/_pgauthier/status/1716768601854628087)," though only those with a national identity based in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. According to the dedicated page, 'Recover' costs "9,99€ per month after the first free month." Why such a not-KYC process should require government identification, and not possibly work with various alternative forms of identity or web-of-trust proofs, is a question left to the reader:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Ledger Recover availability depends on the country in which your passport, national identity card, or driving license was issued. At the moment, a passport/national identity card issued by the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, or a driving license issued in the United States, is required to subscribe to the service. We will be covering more countries and adding support for more documents. Stay tuned.

## FINCEN PROPOSED RULEMAKING ON MIXING

> In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-20th---how-i-knew-your-customer-fatf-compliance) and [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-20th---bank-secrecy-act-and-the-travel-rule), I covered the development of an inter-VASP customer data sharing system for compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Travel Rule, and how FinCEN was seeking to lower the threshold [of reportable activity] (a proposal for which they received "roughly 2,900 comments"); in [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-15th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-2nd---eff-calls-for-coinbase-transparency) and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-17th---how-private-is-my-pay-app), I've followed challenges to the use of the third-party doctrine regarding financial records; in [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), I also highlighted how the effectiveness of anti-money laundering policies came under scrutiny with the release of the '[FinCEN Files](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/)', and interest in identifying '[crypto-exposed persons](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-19th---chainalysis-and-crypto-exposed-persons).'

> ― TMIBP07, "December 10th - THE PATRIOT ACT: SHARE IT ALL"

In [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-10th---the-patriot-act-share-it-all), [TMIBP08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-20th---fincen-proposed-rulemaking-suspended), and [TMIBP09](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/February_2021/#february-1st---fincen-proposed-rulemaking-update), I followed an attempt by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury, "[to require banks and money service businesses (‘MSBs’) to submit reports, keep records, and verify the identity of customers in relation to transactions involving convertible virtual currency (‘CVC’) or digital assets with legal tender status (‘legal tender digital assets’ or ‘LTDA’) held in unhosted wallets](https://web.archive.org/web/20201218212406/https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28437.pdf)." This [notice of proposed rulemaking](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FINCEN-2020-0020) (NPRM) was ultimately suspended in January 2021, but FinCEN continues to justify increasing reporting requirements under the [USA PATRIOT Act of 2001](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/usa-patriot-act).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On October 19th, FinCEN announced [a new NPRM](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/23/2023-23449/proposal-of-special-measure-regarding-convertible-virtual-currency-mixing-as-a-class-of-transactions) that would "[require covered financial institutions to report information about a transaction when they know, suspect, or have reason to suspect it involves [Convertible Virtual Currency] CVC mixing within or involving jurisdictions outside the United States](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-proposes-new-regulation-enhance-transparency-convertible-virtual-currency)," with the stated goal of "increas[ing] transparency around CVC mixing to combat its use by malicious actors including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)." They argue that mixing is "a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern," which under the PATRIOT Act gives the Secretary of the Treasury power to "prohibit, or impose conditions upon, the opening or maintaining in the United States of correspondent or payable-through accounts for or on behalf of a foreign banking institution." They cite the [Bitcoin Fog](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-23449/p-113) case ([TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#august-3rd---the-fog-of-analysis), [TMIBP22](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2023/#april-25th---the-fog-of-analysis-continued)), and OFAC's designation of Ethereum-based mixer Tornado Cash as a sanctioned entity ([TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#august-8th---ofac-sanctions-tornado-cash), [TMIBP21](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2022/#november-22nd---tornado-cash-update), [TMIBP22](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2023/#april-26th---tornado-cash-update-continued)) as a successful prior action. They claim that "this additional transparancy would serve two purposes," namely "support[ing] money laundering investigations" against any "threat to U.S national security and the U.S. financial system," and "deter illicit actors' use of CVC mixing services... to facilitate WMD proliferation, ransomware attackers' laundering of ransoms, and obfuscation of transactions associated with the use of illicit darknet markets."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> FinCEN recognizes that there are legitimate reasons why responsible actors might want to conduct financial transactions in a secure and private manner given the amount of information available on public blockchains. FinCEN also recognizes that, in addition to illicit purposes, CVC mixing may be used for legitimate purposes, such as privacy enhancement for those who live under repressive regimes or wish to conduct licit transactions anonymously.[<sup>70</sup>](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-23449/p-123) Still, CVC mixing presents an acute money laundering risk because it shields information from responsible third parties, such as financial institutions and law enforcement.
> 
> ... Thus, the legitimate applications of CVC mixing must be carefully weighed against the exposure of the U.S. financial system to ongoing illicit use of CVC mixing. Given the substantial risks posed by CVC mixing, the fact that CVC mixing can be used for some legitimate business purposes does not alter FinCEN's conclusion that this class of transactions is of primary money laundering concern.

The proposal does not itself mention specific mixing tools beyond the services that have already been sanctioned or shut down, and unlike prior reports ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-4th---europol-cybercrime-report-on-wasabi-wallet), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-5th---europol-cybercrime-on-wasabi-and-samourai), [TMIBP22](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2023/#december-14th---digital-asset-anti-money-laundering-act-of-2022)) from both themselves and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), they do not include the distinction between mixing "service providers" and "software providers" in their definition of a "CVC mixer."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> [The term “CVC mixer” means any person, group, service, code, tool, or function that facilitates CVC mixing. FinCEN acknowledges this definition is relatively broad; however, given the nature of CVC mixing, FinCEN deems the breadth of this definition to be necessary.](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-23449/p-151)

The [reportable information](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-23449/p-172) to be required from covered institutions, "within 30 calendar days of initial detection of a covered transaction," includes: *the amount of any CVC transferred, in both CVC and its U.S. dollar equivalent when the transaction was initiated; CVC type; the CVC mixer used, if known; CVC wallet address associated with the mixer; CVC wallet address associated with the customer; transaction hash; date of transaction; IP addresses and time stamps associated with the covered transaction; narrative* (e.g. "a description of activity observed by the covered financial institution, including a summary of investigative steps taken, ... [and] if there is an uncharacteristic change in pattern of behavior"); *the customer's full name, date of birth, residential or business address, email address, and unique identifying number* (such as an IRS TIN or foreign equivalent, passport number or other government-issued photo identification number, such as a driver's license).

#### December 7th - LEGENDS OF LIGHTNING WINNERS

In [TMIBP21](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2022/#november-28th---legends-of-lightning-finalist-nolooking), we saw the ‚Äò[NoLooking](https://web.archive.org/web/20221103115644/https://nolooking.chaincase.app/)‚Äô project code their way to the final shortlist of the six-week [Legends of Lightning](https://makers.bolt.fun/tournaments/1/overview) online global [development tournament](https://boltfun.substack.com/p/summoning-all-hackers), with [the goal](https://chaincase.app/words/lightning-payjoin) of making both opening and funding Lightning channels cheaper, easier, and more privacy-preserving using PayJoin.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Our mission was clear: onboard new makers into the ecosystem, innovate on bitcoin and lightning, and help new or existing projects incubate their ideas and turn dreams into a reality. With 260 makers and 73 projects entered across 2 prize tracks (61 üß° + 12 üåç), we believe we got pretty close.

On December 7th, the [tournament winners](https://boltfun.substack.com/p/legendsoflightning-2022-winners) were [announced](https://twitter.com/boltfun_btc/status/1600585864060755968). '[NoLooking](https://twitter.com/boltfun_btc/status/1600585916611010560)' received third place in the [Global Adoption](https://boltfun.substack.com/i/89248284/nolooking) track.

> To restrict transactions in cash and crypto assets, MEPs want to cap payments that can be accepted by persons providing goods or services. They set limits up to ‚Ç¨7000 for cash payments and ‚Ç¨1000 for crypto-asset transfers, where the customer cannot be identified. Given the manifest risk of misuse by criminals, MEPs want to ban any citizenship by investments schemes (‚Äúgolden passports‚Äù) and impose strong AML controls on residence by investment schemes ("golden visas‚Äù).

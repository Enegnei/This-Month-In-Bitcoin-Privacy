#### December 7th - LEGENDS OF LIGHTNING WINNERS

In [TMIBP21](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2022/#november-28th---legends-of-lightning-finalist-nolooking), we saw the ‘[NoLooking](https://web.archive.org/web/20221103115644/https://nolooking.chaincase.app/)’ project code their way to the final shortlist of the six-week [Legends of Lightning](https://makers.bolt.fun/tournaments/1/overview) online global [development tournament](https://boltfun.substack.com/p/summoning-all-hackers), with [the goal](https://chaincase.app/words/lightning-payjoin) of making both opening and funding Lightning channels cheaper, easier, and more privacy-preserving using PayJoin.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Our mission was clear: onboard new makers into the ecosystem, innovate on bitcoin and lightning, and help new or existing projects incubate their ideas and turn dreams into a reality. With 260 makers and 73 projects entered across 2 prize tracks (61 🧡 + 12 🌍), we believe we got pretty close.

On December 7th, the [tournament winners](https://boltfun.substack.com/p/legendsoflightning-2022-winners) were [announced](https://twitter.com/boltfun_btc/status/1600585864060755968). '[NoLooking](https://twitter.com/boltfun_btc/status/1600585916611010560)' received third place in the [Global Adoption](https://boltfun.substack.com/i/89248284/nolooking) track.

#### December 8th - EU CASP REPORTING RULES AND TRANSACTION RESTRICTIONS

The [European Commission](https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1600832223833456641) announced "[an amendment to the Directive for Administration Cooperation (DAC)](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7513)" that would require both EU-based and non-EU based crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) serving EU residents to provide more information on those customers to the relevant authorities. They note that these "new tax transparency rules" will "complement the [Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593) and anti-money laundering rules," and is "consistent" with the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s "[initiative on the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and the amendments to the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS)](https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/crypto-asset-reporting-framework-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.htm)" released in October 2022 (which the 'Leaders of the G20' "[consider to be integral additions to the global standards for automatic exchange of information](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/16/g20-bali-leaders-declaration/)").
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Today's proposal will improve Member States' ability to detect and counter tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, by requiring all crypto-asset service providers – irrespective of their size or location – to report transactions of clients residing in the EU. The Directive also aims to establish a common minimum level of penalties for situations of serious non-compliance, such as the complete absence of reporting despite administrative reminders. Moreover, the Commission suggested extending both reporting obligations of financial institutions to cover e-money and digital currencies and the scope of the automatic exchange of information to advance cross-border rulings used by high net-worth individuals.

I have previously covered proposed crypto-related revisions to E.U. anti-money laundering policy in [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-20th---fatf-report-and-eu-aml-proposals), [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-28th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations), [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-30th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations-update), and [TMIBP21](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2022/#september-30th---european-banking-authority-on-privacy-wallets). Through their [initiative roadmap](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12632-Tax-fraud-evasion-strengthening-rules-on-administrative-cooperation-and-expanding-the-exchange-of-information_en), you can read all feedback on Commission adoption -- including from [Blockchain for Europe (BC4EU)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12632-Tax-fraud-evasion-strengthening-rules-on-administrative-cooperation-and-expanding-the-exchange-of-information/F3391582_en) -- and send in your own until March 30th 2023. "[It is foreseen that the new reporting requirements with regard to crypto-assets, e-money and digital currencies would enter into force on 1 January 2026](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7513)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On March 22nd 2023, the same day that they [advertised](https://twitter.com/EBA_News/status/1638498578459967490) a job opening for "[Supervision Officer Crypto-assets/MiCA](https://www.eba.europa.eu/supervision-officer-crypto-assetsmica)," the European Banking Authority (EBA) published "[findings from its assessment of competent authorities’ approaches to the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision of banks](https://www.eba.europa.eu/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism-supervision-improving-not-always-effective)." "Over the course of 2020 and 2021" they reviewed "how competent authorities in this period’s sample apply the risk-based approach set out in international standards, Directive (EU) 2015/849 andAML/CFT guidelines issued jointly by the European Supervisory Authorities and the EBA." The [report](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2022/1028593/Report%20on%20CAs%20approaches%20to%20AML%20CFT%20supervision.pdf) makes no specific mention of bitcoin or 'crypto-assets,' though in the executive summary of their earlier [2021 Annual Report](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/About%20Us/Annual%20Reports/2021/1035237/EBA%202021%20Annual%20Report.pdf), they claim to have "[identified risks related to virtual currencies](https://www.eba.europa.eu/executive-summary-2021-annual-report)" through subsequent "monitoring," and that these represented "the most significant risks."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In this context, to further strengthen its monitoring and assessment capacity in view of the broadening and deepening of markets in crypto-assets, in  mid-2021 the EBA established a Network on Crypto-assets comprising representatives from the NCAs represented on the EBA’s Board of Supervisors and observers from the Commission, ECB, EIOPA and ESMA. The Network enables a structured exchange of views on market developments, supervisory experiences and regulatory perimeter issues, including taking into account emerging activities such as crypto lending and staking, and new business models, notably decentralised finance. It also supports the aggregation of the results of monitoring activities at the EU level.

To this end, their new [European Reporting System for Material CFT/AML Weaknesses](https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-launches-today-eureca-eus-central-database-anti-money-laundering-and-counter-terrorism-financing) (EuReCA) will likely be involved. "EuReCA will not start to collect personal data until the approval of the draft RTS by the European Commission."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The EBA aims to use EuReCA to gather, structure and share information on financial institutions’ AML/CFT material weaknesses, as identified by competent authorities, and the measures that such authorities have taken to rectify these material weaknesses.
> 
> EuReCA was launched on 31 January 2022. The EBA has since then provided dedicated training to supervisors, followed by regular weekly meetings with users submitting directly to the platform. We have also provided users with a series of supporting materials such as FAQs and user guides.
> 
> Throughout 2022, EBA will continue to support EuReCA’s users in meeting their reporting obligations via FAQs and more in-depth training. The joint controllership arrangements for personal data are also set to be finalised and signed in 2022. As the information reported to EuReCA is expected to grow as time goes on, more time will have to be dedicated to analysing and sharing the information.

Regarding the "data protection aspects of EuReCA," they state:

> One important step also entailed drawing up, together with data protection experts and for the first time at the EBA, a draft data protection impact assessment (DPIA) that first identified and evaluated the risks of processing personal data and then established the necessary controls to mitigate these risks. This also required informal consultation with the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) on both the draft RTS and the draft DPIA, as well as on drafting a memorandum of understanding on joint controllership of personal data by both the EBA and the various relevant authorities concerned.

On March 28th, members of [Parliament](https://twitter.com/EuroParlPress/status/1640701924554027009) in the committees on [Economic and](https://twitter.com/EP_Economics/status/1640689036430917633) [Monetary Affairs](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/econ/home/highlights) (ECON) and [Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/libe/home/highlights) (LIBE) "[adopted their position on three pieces of draft legislation on the financing provisions of EU Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) policy](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230327IPR78511/new-eu-measures-against-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing)." This included the [6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive]() -- succeeding AMLD5 ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-4th---europol-cybercrime-report-on-wasabi-wallet), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-16th---know-your-customers-customer-kycc), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-26th---a-best-guess-bitbargain-closes), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-1st---disjointed-services-flagging-mixed-coins), and [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-20th---fatf-report-and-eu-aml-proposals)) -- and establishment of the [Anti-Money Laundering Authority](https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2021/0240(COD)&l=en) (AMLA) ([TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-20th---fatf-report-and-eu-aml-proposals), [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-30th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations-update)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> To restrict transactions in cash and crypto assets, MEPs want to cap payments that can be accepted by persons providing goods or services. They set limits up to €7000 for cash payments and €1000 for crypto-asset transfers, where the customer cannot be identified. Given the manifest risk of misuse by criminals, MEPs want to ban any citizenship by investments schemes (“golden passports”) and impose strong AML controls on residence by investment schemes ("golden visas”).

On March 29th, the [EBA](https://twitter.com/EBA_News/status/1641015819587952644) opened a public consultation on "[amendments to its Guidelines on risk-based anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision. The proposed changes extend the scope of these Guidelines to AML/CFT supervisors of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). The consultation runs until 29 June 2023](https://www.eba.europa.eu/calendar/consultation-draft-guidelines-amending-risk-based-supervision-guidelines)." During this period, they will also hold "a virtual public hearing" about the [consultation paper](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Consultations/2023/Consultation%20on%20draft%20Guidelines%20amending%20Risk%20Based%20Supervision%20Guidelines/1054077/CP%20on%20Guidelines%20amending%20Risk%20Based%20Supervision%20Guidelines.pdf) on June 7th. "The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using [this link](https://www.eba.europa.eu/meeting-registration/public-meetings/2023/public-hearing-risk-factor-guidelines-and-risk-based) by 5 June 2023 at 16:00 CEST."

#### December 12th - COINBASE TRANSPARENCY REPORT

In [TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea), [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-11th---coinbase-contracting-with-secret-service-irs), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-2nd---eff-calls-for-coinbase-transparency), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-21st---coinbase-releases-transparency-report), [TMIBP16](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2021/#september-16th---coinbase-on-ice), and [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-29th---coinbase-on-ice-update), I have followed **Coinbase**'s contractual relationships with, and data disclosures to, government agencies. In [TMIBP02](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2020/#july-15th---fourth-amendment-lawsuit-against-irs), [TMIBP04](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/September_2020/#september-2nd---eff-calls-for-coinbase-transparency), [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-21st---coinbase-releases-transparency-report), and [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-17th---how-private-is-my-pay-app), I covered the **Electronic Frontier Foundation**'s calls for more transparency from financial technology companies, in addition to challenging the use of the third-party doctrine with financial records. **Coinbase** [chief legal officer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-grewal-288978b4) [Paul Grewal](https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1602355416309997568) ([TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-21st---coinbase-releases-transparency-report), [TMIBP21](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2022/#november-22nd---tornado-cash-update)) has published their fourth "[Transparency Report 2022](https://archive.ph/CbvO5)," which concerns "data about requests for their information that we receive from government agencies and law enforcement" during "the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022." Their [first](https://archive.is/6gQfQ), [second](https://archive.is/JhBpB), and [third](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-transparency-report-q1-q3-2021) transparency reports since 2020 are linked respectively.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Compared to the last period, Grewal states that they have seen "a ~66% increase" in the total number of requests. American law enforcement and government agencies had sent over 4,700 requests. "As in years past, the overwhelming majority of requests we received both globally and in the U.S. were from law enforcement agencies in connection with criminal enforcement matters." Within the "~57% of requests" that were "from outside of the United States," the top three countries with more than 1,000 requests each were the U.K., Germany, and Spain.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On January 4th, the [New York State Department of Financial Services](https://twitter.com/NYDFS/status/1610672504770629635) (NYDFS) announced in settlement that Coinbase would "[pay a $50 million penalty to New York State for significant failures in its compliance program that violated the New York Banking Law and the New York State Department of Financial Services’ (DFS) virtual currency, money transmitter, transaction monitoring, and cybersecurity regulations](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202301041)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"} 

> Coinbase has been licensed by the Department to conduct a virtual currency business and money transmitting business in the State of New York since 2017. Following an examination and subsequent enforcement investigation, the Department found that Coinbase’s Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering program — including its Know Your Customer/Customer Due Diligence (“KYC/CDD”), Transaction Monitoring System (“TMS”), suspicious activity reporting, and sanctions compliance systems — were inadequate for a financial services provider of Coinbase’s size and complexity.

According to the [consent order](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/ea20230104_coinbase.pdf), "the Department conducted a safety and soundness examination" in 2020, and subsequently "required Coinbase to hire an independent consultant" to access their BSA/AML and OFAC compliance. Following the completion of the consultant's report in February 2021, "the Department began an enforcement investigation" involving a mandated 'Independent Monitor' who provided a further report in August 2022. They concluded that "Coinbase’s KYC/CDD program, both as written and as implemented, was immature and inadequate."
{: style="text-align: justify;"} 

> In direct response to the Department’s findings and the findings and recommendations of the Independent Consultant and Independent Monitor retained at the Department’s direction, Coinbase has invested very substantial time and resources in an effort to remediate its issues and strengthen its Compliance Program more generally. With regard to KYC/EDD issues, for example, Coinbase, among other things, has implemented for all new accounts a dynamic risk rating model for both retail and institutional customers, is undertaking a KYC Refresh of all customers onboarded before the risk rating system was implemented, and has instituted new periodic review procedures. Likewise, with respect to transaction monitoring and SAR reporting, Coinbase has, among other things, upgraded its investigations portal to streamline the process of reviewing transaction monitoring alerts and filing SARs.

One may notice that since the [creation](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/04/ea140311_proposals_vc_exchanges.pdf) of the '[BitLicense](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/virtual_currency_businesses)' regulation in 2015, NYDFS has published [three enforcement actions](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/enforcement_actions_lfs) in the category of 'Virtual Currency,' all within the last year. According to the [**New York Times**](https://archive.ph/k3BH2)' reporting on this Coinbase settlement, "To date, the state has issued roughly 30" licenses.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Meanwhile, Coinbase continues to support and profit from blockchain surveillance ([TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-29th---coinbase-on-ice-update)). Based on public procurement records, the *Landeskriminalamt Nordrhein-Westfalen* (state bureau of investigation) in Düsseldorf recently extended their licenses for [Coinbase Tracer](https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:015656-2023:TEXT:EN:HTML), valued at €485,000, and [Chainalysis' 'Reactor'](https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:15571-2023:TEXT:EN:HTML), valued at €1,108,800. Similarly, in February, the *Komenda Główna Policji* (Polish national police headquarters) in Warsaw [purchased a Chainalysis license](https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:114902-2023:TEXT:EN:HTML) valued at €139,786.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

However, their provision of this service is not mentioned at all in their [transparency report](https://archive.ph/CbvO5). Since blockchain surveillance tools affect the financial privacy of their customers (as well as non-Coinbase customers), and the goal of their report is supposedly to provide "a view into how government policies and actions intersect with customer privacy," I would argue that including a list of the agencies and offices subscribed to Coinbase Tracer is more than appropriate. As you have seen in my newsletter, these records are often public record anyway!

In [TMIBP05](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2020/#october-8th---cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework), [08](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/January_2021/#january-27th---chimeras-of-central-bank-digital-currency), [12](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/May_2021/#may-13th---financial-freedom-and-privacy), [14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-4th---the-freedom-of-bitcoin), [17](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/October_2021/#october-9th---a-future-under-central-bank-digital-currency), [19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-14th---cbdcs-in-emerging-market-economies), [20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-2nd---cbdcs-in-major-market-economies), and [21](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2022/#november-21st---anti-cbdc-campaigns), I have followed exploration, promotion, and criticism of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In the last newsletter, I highlighted a fellowship offered by the **Human Rights Foundation** (HRF) to build "an online resource that tracks the progress of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in every country in the world and flags their risks for civil liberties." I'm very pleased to [share](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1624122632315744261) that a team composed of myself, Matthew Mežinskis, and Nick Anthony was awarded this fellowship. Matthew recently gave [an extensive interview](https://youtu.be/bzWYFdAGqsQ) about his research on central banking in [episode #645](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/the-failure-of-central-banking) of [**What Bitcoin Did**](https://twitter.com/WhatBitcoinDid/status/1646888419098853376). We will be able to share more about our work on this project in the coming months, and there may be a special announcement at this year's [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/financialfreedom-2023/)! :purple_heart:

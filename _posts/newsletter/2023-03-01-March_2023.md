#### December 7th - LEGENDS OF LIGHTNING WINNERS

In [TMIBP21](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2022/#november-28th---legends-of-lightning-finalist-nolooking), we saw the ‘[NoLooking](https://web.archive.org/web/20221103115644/https://nolooking.chaincase.app/)’ project code their way to the final shortlist of the six-week [Legends of Lightning](https://makers.bolt.fun/tournaments/1/overview) online global [development tournament](https://boltfun.substack.com/p/summoning-all-hackers), with [the goal](https://chaincase.app/words/lightning-payjoin) of making both opening and funding Lightning channels cheaper, easier, and more privacy-preserving using PayJoin.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Our mission was clear: onboard new makers into the ecosystem, innovate on bitcoin and lightning, and help new or existing projects incubate their ideas and turn dreams into a reality. With 260 makers and 73 projects entered across 2 prize tracks (61 🧡 + 12 🌍), we believe we got pretty close.

On December 7th, the [tournament winners](https://boltfun.substack.com/p/legendsoflightning-2022-winners) were [announced](https://twitter.com/boltfun_btc/status/1600585864060755968). '[NoLooking](https://twitter.com/boltfun_btc/status/1600585916611010560)' received third place in the [Global Adoption](https://boltfun.substack.com/i/89248284/nolooking) track.

#### December 8th - EU CASP REPORTING RULES AND TRANSACTION RESTRICTIONS

The [European Commission](https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1600832223833456641) announced "[an amendment to the Directive for Administration Cooperation (DAC)](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7513)" that would require both EU-based and non-EU based crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) serving EU residents to provide more information on those customers to the relevant authorities. They note that these "new tax transparency rules" will "complement the [Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593) and anti-money laundering rules," and is "consistent" with the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s "[initiative on the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and the amendments to the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS)](https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/crypto-asset-reporting-framework-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.htm)" released in October 2022 (which the 'Leaders of the G20' "[consider to be integral additions to the global standards for automatic exchange of information](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/16/g20-bali-leaders-declaration/)").
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Today's proposal will improve Member States' ability to detect and counter tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, by requiring all crypto-asset service providers – irrespective of their size or location – to report transactions of clients residing in the EU. The Directive also aims to establish a common minimum level of penalties for situations of serious non-compliance, such as the complete absence of reporting despite administrative reminders. Moreover, the Commission suggested extending both reporting obligations of financial institutions to cover e-money and digital currencies and the scope of the automatic exchange of information to advance cross-border rulings used by high net-worth individuals.

I have previously covered proposed crypto-related revisions to E.U. anti-money laundering policy in [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-20th---fatf-report-and-eu-aml-proposals), [TMIBP19](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/April_2022/#april-28th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations), [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-30th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations-update), and [TMIBP21](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2022/#september-30th---european-banking-authority-on-privacy-wallets). Through their [initiative roadmap](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12632-Tax-fraud-evasion-strengthening-rules-on-administrative-cooperation-and-expanding-the-exchange-of-information_en), you can read all feedback on Commission adoption -- including from [Blockchain for Europe (BC4EU)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12632-Tax-fraud-evasion-strengthening-rules-on-administrative-cooperation-and-expanding-the-exchange-of-information/F3391582_en) -- and send in your own until March 30th 2023. "[It is foreseen that the new reporting requirements with regard to crypto-assets, e-money and digital currencies would enter into force on 1 January 2026](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7513)."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On March 22nd 2023, the same day that they [advertised](https://twitter.com/EBA_News/status/1638498578459967490) a job opening for "[Supervision Officer Crypto-assets/MiCA](https://www.eba.europa.eu/supervision-officer-crypto-assetsmica)," the European Banking Authority (EBA) published "[findings from its assessment of competent authorities’ approaches to the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision of banks](https://www.eba.europa.eu/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism-supervision-improving-not-always-effective)." "Over the course of 2020 and 2021" they reviewed "how competent authorities in this period’s sample apply the risk-based approach set out in international standards, Directive (EU) 2015/849 andAML/CFT guidelines issued jointly by the European Supervisory Authorities and the EBA." The [report](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2022/1028593/Report%20on%20CAs%20approaches%20to%20AML%20CFT%20supervision.pdf) makes no specific mention of bitcoin or 'crypto-assets,' though in the executive summary of their earlier [2021 Annual Report](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/About%20Us/Annual%20Reports/2021/1035237/EBA%202021%20Annual%20Report.pdf), they claim to have "[identified risks related to virtual currencies](https://www.eba.europa.eu/executive-summary-2021-annual-report)" through subsequent "monitoring," and that these represented "the most significant risks."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> In this context, to further strengthen its monitoring and assessment capacity in view of the broadening and deepening of markets in crypto-assets, in  mid-2021 the EBA established a Network on Crypto-assets comprising representatives from the NCAs represented on the EBA’s Board of Supervisors and observers from the Commission, ECB, EIOPA and ESMA. The Network enables a structured exchange of views on market developments, supervisory experiences and regulatory perimeter issues, including taking into account emerging activities such as crypto lending and staking, and new business models, notably decentralised finance. It also supports the aggregation of the results of monitoring activities at the EU level.

To this end, their new [European Reporting System for Material CFT/AML Weaknesses](https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-launches-today-eureca-eus-central-database-anti-money-laundering-and-counter-terrorism-financing) (EuReCA) will likely be involved. "EuReCA will not start to collect personal data until the approval of the draft RTS by the European Commission."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The EBA aims to use EuReCA to gather, structure and share information on financial institutions’ AML/CFT material weaknesses, as identified by competent authorities, and the measures that such authorities have taken to rectify these material weaknesses.
> 
> EuReCA was launched on 31 January 2022. The EBA has since then provided dedicated training to supervisors, followed by regular weekly meetings with users submitting directly to the platform. We have also provided users with a series of supporting materials such as FAQs and user guides.
> 
> Throughout 2022, EBA will continue to support EuReCA’s users in meeting their reporting obligations via FAQs and more in-depth training. The joint controllership arrangements for personal data are also set to be finalised and signed in 2022. As the information reported to EuReCA is expected to grow as time goes on, more time will have to be dedicated to analysing and sharing the information.

Regarding the "data protection aspects of EuReCA," they state:

> One important step also entailed drawing up, together with data protection experts and for the first time at the EBA, a draft data protection impact assessment (DPIA) that first identified and evaluated the risks of processing personal data and then established the necessary controls to mitigate these risks. This also required informal consultation with the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) on both the draft RTS and the draft DPIA, as well as on drafting a memorandum of understanding on joint controllership of personal data by both the EBA and the various relevant authorities concerned.

On March 28th, members of [Parliament](https://twitter.com/EuroParlPress/status/1640701924554027009) in the committees on [Economic and](https://twitter.com/EP_Economics/status/1640689036430917633) [Monetary Affairs](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/econ/home/highlights) (ECON) and [Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/libe/home/highlights) (LIBE) "[adopted their position on three pieces of draft legislation on the financing provisions of EU Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) policy](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230327IPR78511/new-eu-measures-against-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing)." This included the [6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive]() -- succeeding AMLD5 ([TMIBP01](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-4th---europol-cybercrime-report-on-wasabi-wallet), [TMIBP06](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/November_2020/#november-16th---know-your-customers-customer-kycc), [TMIBP07](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/December_2020/#december-26th---a-best-guess-bitbargain-closes), [TMIBP10](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/March_2021/#march-1st---disjointed-services-flagging-mixed-coins), and [TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-20th---fatf-report-and-eu-aml-proposals)) -- and establishment of the [Anti-Money Laundering Authority](https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2021/0240(COD)&l=en) (AMLA) ([TMIBP14](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/July_2021/#july-20th---fatf-report-and-eu-aml-proposals), [TMIBP20](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/August_2022/#june-30th---european-union-trilogue-negotiations-update)).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> To restrict transactions in cash and crypto assets, MEPs want to cap payments that can be accepted by persons providing goods or services. They set limits up to €7000 for cash payments and €1000 for crypto-asset transfers, where the customer cannot be identified. Given the manifest risk of misuse by criminals, MEPs want to ban any citizenship by investments schemes (“golden passports”) and impose strong AML controls on residence by investment schemes ("golden visas”).

On March 29th, the [EBA](https://twitter.com/EBA_News/status/1641015819587952644) opened a public consultation on "[amendments to its Guidelines on risk-based anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision. The proposed changes extend the scope of these Guidelines to AML/CFT supervisors of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). The consultation runs until 29 June 2023](https://www.eba.europa.eu/calendar/consultation-draft-guidelines-amending-risk-based-supervision-guidelines)." During this period, they will also hold "a virtual public hearing" on the [consultation paper](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Consultations/2023/Consultation%20on%20draft%20Guidelines%20amending%20Risk%20Based%20Supervision%20Guidelines/1054077/CP%20on%20Guidelines%20amending%20Risk%20Based%20Supervision%20Guidelines.pdf) on June 7th. "The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using [this link](https://www.eba.europa.eu/meeting-registration/public-meetings/2023/public-hearing-risk-factor-guidelines-and-risk-based) by 5 June 2023 at 16:00 CEST."

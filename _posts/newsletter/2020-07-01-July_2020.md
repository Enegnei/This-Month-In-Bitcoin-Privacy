## IRS SEEKING TOOLS TO TRACE PRIVACY COINS AND LIGHTNING

On June 30th, the same [IRS](https://archive.is/Vrcce) division we highlighted in [the last edition](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea) published a [request for information](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cryptocurrencytracing-rfifinal.pdf) regarding "systems that will allow developers and testers to conduct investigative research of distributed ledger transactions involving privacy cryptocurrency coins," "Layer 2 off-chain protocol networks," "Side-chains," and "tracing challenges following the integration of the Schnorr Signature algorithm."

They write that they are seeking "an interactive prototype that provides a GUI for clustering transactions involving a user (similar to tools provided by companies like Chainalysis, CipherTrace, Coinbase, and Elliptic but for the privacy coins and obfuscation technologies)," with "OSINT information/research about identified users," and "a mechanism for sharing investigative research between investigators."

Regarding the Lightning Network, they suggest that "there is potential to develop solutions for tracking illicit actors" by "building off of monitoring code" like Lightning Lab's [Lndmon](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lndmon). As for Schnorr, "Schnorr Signature presents a new challenge for investigative support services with no COTS [commercial off-the-shelf] solutions publicly available." Though [Schnorr signatures](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki) have not been added to Bitcoin yet, "this integration has multiple benefits to users including a reduction in the distributed ledger storage requirements as well as enhanced privacy to protect users, but this also inhibits the effectiveness of certain traditional tracing clustering algorithms."

The deadline for responding to their request is July 14th.

On the same day that the request was published, the [United States District Court for the Western District of Texas](http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/19/19-50492-CR0.pdf) countered a defendant's argument that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy for his Bitcoin transactions, citing [*Carpenter v. United States*](https://www.aclu.org/cases/carpenter-v-united-states) (2018). Under "the third-party doctrine, the Supreme Court in *United States v. Miller* held that bank records were not subject to Fourth Amendment protections." Due to "Coinbase records" being "more akin to the bank records," and the "publicity" of transaction information on the Bitcoin blockchain, the circuit judges concluded that "Gratkowski thus lacked a privacy interest."

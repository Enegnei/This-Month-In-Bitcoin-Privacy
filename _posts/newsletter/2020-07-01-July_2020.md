## June 30th - IRS SEEKING TOOLS TO TRACE PRIVACY COINS, LIGHTNING

The same [IRS](https://archive.is/Vrcce) division we highlighted in [the last edition](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/#june-5th---coinbase-offers-blockchain-surveillance-to-irs-dea) published a [request for information](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cryptocurrencytracing-rfifinal.pdf) regarding "systems that will allow developers and testers to conduct investigative research of distributed ledger transactions involving privacy cryptocurrency coins," "Layer 2 off-chain protocol networks," "Side-chains," and "tracing challenges following the integration of the Schnorr Signature algorithm."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

They write that they are seeking "an interactive prototype that provides a GUI for clustering transactions involving a user (similar to tools provided by companies like Chainalysis, CipherTrace, Coinbase, and Elliptic but for the privacy coins and obfuscation technologies)," with "OSINT information/research about identified users," and "a mechanism for sharing investigative research between investigators."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Regarding the Lightning Network, they suggest that "there is potential to develop solutions for tracking illicit actors" by "building off of monitoring code" like Lightning Lab's [Lndmon](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lndmon). As for Schnorr signatures, they present "a new challenge for investigative support services with no COTS [commercial off-the-shelf] solutions publicly available." Though [Schnorr signatures](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki) have not been added to Bitcoin yet, "this integration has multiple benefits to users including a reduction in the distributed ledger storage requirements as well as enhanced privacy to protect users, but this also inhibits the effectiveness of certain traditional tracing clustering algorithms."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The deadline for responding to their request is July 14th.

On the same day that the request was published, the [United States District Court for the Western District of Texas](http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/19/19-50492-CR0.pdf) countered a defendant's argument that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy for his Bitcoin transactions, citing [*Carpenter v. United States*](https://www.aclu.org/cases/carpenter-v-united-states) (2018). Under "the third-party doctrine, the Supreme Court in *United States v. Miller* held that bank records were not subject to Fourth Amendment protections." Due to "Coinbase records" being "more akin to the bank records," and the "publicity" of transaction information on the Bitcoin blockchain, the circuit judges concluded that "Gratkowski thus lacked a privacy interest."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

>  Bitcoin users have the option to maintain a high level of privacy by transacting without a third-party intermediary. But that requires technical expertise, so 
Bitcoin users may elect to sacrifice some privacy by transacting through an intermediary such as Coinbase.

## July 7th - CHAINALYSIS AND THE BOILING FROG

[**Chainalysis**](https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1280516288775847946) announced via [PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chainalysis-expands-series-b-to-49m-with-investment-from-ribbit-capital-and-sound-ventures-301089238.html) that they had "raised an additional $13M to expand its Series B round to $49M with an investment from Ribbit Capital and Sound Ventures." As California-based venture capital firms, [Ribbet Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/organization-guest/company/ribbit-capital) "invests globally in unique individuals and brands who aim to disrupt the financial services industry," with [portfolio companies](https://archive.is/1R2Q3) including Coinbase, Robinhood, and Xapo. [Sound Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/organization-guest/company/sound-ventures) focuses "on early and mid stage private technology platforms."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Over the past year, the company has continued to enhance its unrivaled blockchain data and foundational investigative product, Chainalysis Reactor, providing insights into how and why people move money across the world and growing revenue from new government customers by almost 400%.

The announcement also highlighted that Ribbet Capital's new [general partner](https://archive.vn/LjWtA), Sigal Mandelker, would also become part of Chainalysis' board of advisors. According to [Forbes](https://archive.is/UbAtj), she "will meet with the Chainalysis team on an as-needed basis to share with them insights gleaned from her own past experience investigating crime that relies on blockchain." Prior to joining Ribbet in April, Mandelker had been serving as [under-secretary](https://web.archive.org/web/20180416215037/https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/Pages/sigal_mandelker.aspx) for the [U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence](https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Terrorism-and-Financial-Intelligence.aspx) (TFI) from June 2017 until sometime near October 2019. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-sanctions-idUSKBN1WH1Z0) reported that "Mandelker had approached Mnuchin," Secretary of the Treasury, "over the summer about her desire to return to the private sector." She was most well known for being "[one of the most powerful officials designing](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/mandelker-iran-sanctions/594412/)" the Trump administration's "financial warfare" strategies against countries like Iran and Venezuela.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

During CoinDesk's Consensus Conference last year, Mandelker had [delivered a speech](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm687) about how "bad actors are trying to leverage virtual currencies to make an end-run around our laws and regulations," and urged "the industry to prioritize compliance before choosing to bring a product or service to the market." She cited her prior experience leading "a team of prosecutors at the Department of Justice more than a decade ago that successfully prosecuted the digital currency E-Gold." Coincidentally, on July 2nd, the E-gold defendants have [petitioned](https://legalupdate.e-gold.com/2020/07/petition-for-writ-of-error-coram-nobis.html) [the court](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/211.pdf) "to issue a writ of error" [*coram nobis*](https://definitions.uslegal.com/w/writ-of-coram-nobis/) "and vacate, with prejudice, Petitioners’ convictions."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

As [Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice](https://web.archive.org/web/20180416215037/https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/Pages/sigal_mandelker.aspx), she had overseen "four major prosecutorial sections and a number of significant cross-border prosecutions involving cybersecurity, human rights, money laundering, and other national security and law enforcement priorities." She does not list any of them specifically. However, as of a year ago this month, the [Washington Post](https://archive.is/f4Luu) had reported that Mandelker was named as one of the "high-ranking Justice Department officials" who "approved of or were otherwise involved" in Jeffrey Epstein's so-called '[Florida deal](https://web.archive.org/web/20181128153832/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html).'
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Epstein, 66, was arrested about a week ago and charged federally with sexually abusing dozens of children from 2002 to 2005. His case has riveted the nation, in part because of his wealth and connections, and partly because of a plea deal he reached in 2008 to resolve similar allegations.
>
> The deal allowed Epstein to spend only about a year in jail and plead guilty only to state crimes, avoiding federal charges entirely. It was approved by then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, who was later tapped to be President Trump’s labor secretary. Acosta resigned Friday amid the metastasizing controversy surrounding his handling of the case.
>
> ... Defense attorneys also argued, as they have in the past, that prosecutors are rehashing allegations for which Epstein has already served time. They noted that high-ranking Justice Department officials approved of or were otherwise involved in his agreement to avoid federal charges, including Mark Filip, [who was] deputy attorney general at the time; Alice Fisher, who led the department’s criminal division; John Roth, who worked in the criminal division and the deputy attorney general’s office; and Sigal Mandelker, who worked in the criminal division and now works at the Treasury Department.

In an interview with [National Public Radio](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/740159741/former-u-s-prosecutor-discusses-jeffrey-epsteins-2008-plea-deal) (NPR), former U.S. federal assistant attorney [Berit Berger](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jeffrey-epstein-s-deal-federal-prosectors-wasn-t-normal-men-ncna974911) stated that "non-prosecution agreements are fairly common within the Department of Justice," but for a human / child sex trafficking case they "are not common at all; in fact, I would say they're almost unheard of." In February 2019, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra had described "the Government’s decision to conceal the existence of the NPA and mislead the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility" as "particularly problematic," and [ruled](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000169-11f3-d0be-adfb-75fff4490000) that "there was a violation of the victims rights under the CVRA" [[Crime Victims' Rights Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3771)].
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

While these officials have not clearly confirmed or denied their involvement in the decision, the time of departure for both Mandelker and [Acosta](https://web.archive.org/web/20190712142740/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/12/labor-secretary-alex-acosta-resigned-amid-jeffrey-epstein-fallout/1681245001/) is worth noting. In defense of Acosta, Trump had said, "I do hear there were a lot of people involved in that decision, not just him." Furthermore, [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/60faa70ed835f7b0e7c5f15f84355c0a) reported that Epstein's alleged confidante and co-conspirator, [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-charged-manhattan-federal-court-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually), may attempt to claim immunity under Epstein's non-prosecution agreement. This would explain why the Justice Department's [focus](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1291491/download) is strangely limited to "1994 through at least 1997."
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In April 2008, a few months before Epstein was sentenced under those lenient charges, Mandelker had spoken before the [U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-hrsp/legacy/2010/07/29/04-09-08nelson-hearing.pdf) about "closing legal loopholes" for "citizens employed as United States government personnel and contractors" who had been accused of sexual assault.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Sexual assault cases often involve the most vulnerable victims and must be treated with the utmost seriousness.  Whether this conduct occurs with in the United States or overseas and in a dangerous military zone, these offenders must be brought to justice.   

Within the announcement that Mandelker had been acquired as an advisor to [Chainalysis](http://web.archive.org/web/20200701085855/https://www.chainalysis.com/), she stated that the company "has done terrific work providing blockchain analysis and tools to financial institutions, government agencies, and exchanges," and is "excited" to work with them in "root[ing] out illicit networks."

*The '[boiling frog](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/boiling+frog)' is a metaphor for "a problematic situation that will gradually increase in severity until it reaches calamitous proportions, such that the people involved or affected by it will not notice the danger until it is too late to act."*

## June 2nd - COINSQUARE DATA BREACH

**VICE Motherboard** tech journalist [Joseph Cox](https://twitter.com/josephfcox) published an article warning that an unidentified hacker or group intended to [use data stolen from Canadian exchange **Coinsquare**](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wnvb/hackers-coinsquare-data-bitcoin-sim-swapping) for carrying out SIM swapping attacks on impacted customers. He was able to verify the authenticity of the data -- consisting of "5,000 rows" of user names -- by "attempting to make accounts on Coinsquare with a random selection of email addresses," contacting "a number of people listed," and providing "a limited set of screenshots of the data to Coinsquare." Coinsquare general counsel Stacey Hosiak claimed that they "became aware of the issue about a year ago," and it was "the result of employee theft of information contained within a client relationship database used for prospecting." At this point, the company had not yet disclosed the data breach publicly.

Their first [direct public disclosure](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinCA/comments/gxc32w/coinsquare_ceo_response_to_data_breach/) was not posted until June 5th, on the Bitcoin Canadian subreddit. CEO Cole Diamond claimed that they had "spent the better part of this week preparing and then communicating with all our users, both affected and not affected," and implemented "precautionary measures" to prevent unauthorized withdrawals. He linked to three different versions of the email that had been sent out to customers, of which 3,653 "did have some form of 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) leaked," including names, emails, phone numbers and postal addresses. These emails were written by Hosiak and Chief Privacy & Anti-Money Laundering Officer Charlene Cieslik. Two days later, the report from Diamond was copy-pasted almost word-for-word to their [company blog](https://blog.coinsquare.com/coinsquare-ceo-response-to-data-breach/) and [shared on social media](https://twitter.com/Coinsquare/status/1269758772735508480).

In all of their public communications, including the published emails to customers, Coinsquare not only refused to link to the Motherboard article which broke the story, but made no mention of the explicit threat made to SIM swap customers. They emphasized that the intent was to "embarass the company," and that "there is no risk to your Coinsquare account," despite the fact that they happened to update and republish a blog post about "[How to Increase Your Coinsquare Account Security](https://blog.coinsquare.com/how-to-increase-your-coinsquare-account-security-updated-2020/)" only one day after the article was published. The blog post recommends turning on two-factor authentication and using password managers.

:warning: If you know or suspect that you were impacted by this breach, I recommend reading Kraken's "[Security Advisory: Mobile Phones](https://blog.kraken.com/post/219/security-advisory-mobile-phones/)," Jameson Lopp's "[The Dos and Don'ts of Bitcoin Key Management](https://blog.keys.casa/the-dos-and-donts-of-bitcoin-key-management/)," and "[A Modest Privacy Protection Proposal](https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/)."

## June 4th - EUROPOL CYBERCRIME CENTRE REPORT ON WASABI WALLET

**CoinDesk** journalist [Alyssa Hertig](https://twitter.com/AlyssaHertig) shared [a report](https://web.archive.org/web/20200606093325/https://www.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_5096130532387848318.pdf), intended for law enforcement only, from **Europol's European Cybercrime Centre** (EC3). Produced in two parts that were published in April and May respectively, it explains how [Wasabi Wallet](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) works and "the possibilities for law enforcement investigations. Spoiler alert: things are not looking good."

The report begins by remarking that "in the last period, Europol's EC3 started to notice an increasing number of investigations involving Wasabi Wallet." To the question '*How popular is the service?*' they reply: "Certainly popular enough to spark our interest." Their blockchain analysis graphics appear to be sourced from Chainalysis software, and at one point they cite Chainalysis as having identified Wasabi addresses.

They make clear that in terms of tracking funds and deanonymizing users of Wasabi, the going has been tough. Under the section '*Can Wasabi transactions be demixed?*' they write that "realistically speaking, in most cases the answer is negative," and there may only be "a glimpse of hope if the suspect makes a mistake and decides to group the mixed coins together," an act known as [consolidation](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Techniques_to_reduce_transaction_fees#Consolidation).

Due to Wasabi's non-custodial nature, "the AML (anti-money laundering) legislation including Europe's latest AMLD5 (the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive)," which entered into force in July 2018, "does not apply to this service." The [legislation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018L0843) made an effort to include virtual currency-related services as "obliged entities," but this was mostly limited to custodial wallets and exchanges. They were even aware that:

> inclusion of providers engaged in exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies and custodian wallet providers will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without such providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to obtain information allowing them to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currency. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.


## June 5th - COINBASE OFFERS BLOCKCHAIN SURVEILLANCE TO IRS, DEA

[**The Block**](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/67551/coinbase-irs-dea-analytics-neutrino) managing editor [Michael McSweeney](https://twitter.com/mpmcsweeney) published an article which pointed to documents in two U.S. federal contracting and grant-making databases, [System for Award Management (SAM)](https://archive.is/h8pIT) and [GovTribe](https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/coinbase-analytics-web-subscription-5000090561). They showed that "the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intend to buy licenses from Coinbase for an analytics platform called Coinbase Analytics."

In the case of [the DEA application](http://web.archive.org/web/20200611002635/https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/dealsj-0006-limitedsourcedocumentationcoinbase.pdf), which has been substantially redacted, it is claimed that Coinbase Analytics will provide "investigators with identity attribution and de-anonymi[ze] virtual currency addresses domestically and internationally," using "the most conservative heuristics... in commercial blockchain tracing tools. This is critical in avoiding false positive during target identification." As for the IRS, it will be utilized in their Criminal Investigation (CI) Cyber Crimes Unit (CCU) for "analysis and tracking of cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains that criminals are currently using." They also note that Coinbase Analytics was 'formerly known as' [Neutrino](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/grim-stories-of-ethical-privacy-abuses-emerge-about-coinbases-new-partners), an Italian blockchain surveillance company acquired by Coinbase in [February 2019](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/neutrino_coinbase-acquisition-agreement.pdf).

> Its two flagships, XFlow nSpect and XFlow nSight, are billed as “comprehensive solution[s] for monitoring[,] analyzing and tracking cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains.” nSight was built to help exchanges and financial service companies like Coinbase to stay regulatorily compliant. nSpect, on the other hand, was built for “criminal investigations and intelligence gathering” and is specifically marketed toward law enforcement.

Neutrino was one of many [splinter companies](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/1265564545105506307) that were created or joined by former members of Hacking Team, notorious for selling offensive surveillance technology to clients around the world, [no matter their human rights record](https://rsf.org/en/news/special-report-internet-surveillance-focusing-5-governments-and-5-companies-enemies-internet). However this was not the group's first foray into bitcoin tracking; when they were hacked themselves in 2015, it was discovered that the Egyptian and Saudi governments had emailed support questions about a '[Money Module](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/hacking-team-broke-bitcoin-secrecy-by-targeting-crucial-wallet-file/)' in their Remote Control System (RCS) suite. Alberto Ornaghi claimed the tool could get the following data from user wallets:

> the information we can get are: addressbook (list of all contacts and local accounts of the target), files (the wallet itself, containing the money and spend it for private keys), transactions (transaction history in/out of the target , useful for making correlations).

Luckily, Hacking Team was recently declared "[dead, definitely dead](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/1265561736876343300)" by CEO David Vincenzetti at the end of May. If Brian Armstrong is to be believed (debatable), Neutrino and Coinbase parted ways in March 2019 after they finally noticed "[a gap in our diligence process](https://archive.is/mryOy)," though outrage clearly can't [keep them apart for good](https://twitter.com/J9Roem/status/1269055590237601793). It is not publicly known what the capabilities of Neutrino's XFlow nSight and nSpect products are, but you could say that this news of a potential partnership between Coinbase and the DEA represents a "full circle." In the same email about the 'Money Module' from 2014, Ornaghi included this question:

> we can also make a bitcoin transaction to buy drugs and see in the form of correlation to those who got that money **(DEA: anyone interested? :P)**


## June 10th - HUMAN RIGHTS FOUNDATION LAUNCHES DEV FUND

The [**Human Rights Foundation** (HRF)](https://twitter.com/HRF/status/1270753984437944320) announced their new '[Bitcoin Development Fund](https://hrf.org/programs_posts/devfund/),' focused on "making the Bitcoin network more private, decentralized, and resilient so that it can better serve as a financial tool for human rights activists, civil society organizations, and journalists around the world." The first grant, which according to [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-human-rights-foundation-is-now-funding-bitcoin-privacy-development-starting-with-coinswap) is "worth close to $50,000," has been gifted to Bitcoin developer and privacy expert Chris Belcher. HRF sourced this money from a private individual who wished to donate $100,000 to Bitcoin development, no strings attached. HRF also states their intent to continue helping other developers through an ongoing crowdfunding campaign in USD and bitcoin. Bitcoin donations can be made through their [BTCPay server integration](https://hrf.org/donate-bitcoin/), designed by [**@artdesignbySF**](https://twitter.com/artdesignbySF/status/1237019806848692227). Chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein said:

> “Human rights defenders and reporters around the world face increasing financial repression in the form of frozen bank accounts, restrictions on foreign funding, payment surveillance, and general difficulty in earning income or receiving donations... With more support, developers like Chris can make it possible for activists to receive donations and continue their important work under increased pressure.”

Belcher was chosen not only for his previous work on [JoinMarket](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/JoinMarket), [the comprehensive privacy guide for Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy), and [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server), but because he recently published a software design spec for CoinSwaps, titled "[*Design for a CoinSwap Implementation for Massively Improving Bitcoin Privacy and Fungibility*](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964)." He argues that "CoinSwap is the next step for on-chain bitcoin privacy," especially when used in combination with 2-party ECDSA multisignature addresses or (if adopted) Schnorr signatures with Musig.

## June 5th

[**The Block**](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/67551/coinbase-irs-dea-analytics-neutrino) managing editor [Michael McSweeney](https://twitter.com/mpmcsweeney) published an article which pointed to documents in two U.S. federal contracting and grant-making databases, [System for Award Management (SAM)](https://archive.is/h8pIT) and [GovTribe](https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/coinbase-analytics-web-subscription-5000090561). They showed that "the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intend to buy licenses from Coinbase for an analytics platform called Coinbase Analytics."

In the case of [the DEA application](http://web.archive.org/web/20200611002635/https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/dealsj-0006-limitedsourcedocumentationcoinbase.pdf), which has been substantially redacted, it is claimed that Coinbase Analytics will provide "investigators with identity attribution and de-anonymi[ze] virtual currency addresses domestically and internationally," using "the most conservative heuristics... in commercial blockchain tracing tools. This is critical in avoiding false positive during target identification." As for the IRS, it will be utilized in their Criminal Investigation (CI) Cyber Crimes Unit (CCU) for "analysis and tracking of cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains that criminals are currently using." They also note that Coinbase Analytics was 'formerly known as' Neutrino, which Coinbase [acquired in February 2019](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/neutrino_coinbase-acquisition-agreement.pdf).

Neutrino was one of many splinter companies that were created or joined by former members of Hacking Team, notorious for selling offensive surveillance technology to clients around the world, [no matter their human rights record or targets](https://rsf.org/en/news/special-report-internet-surveillance-focusing-5-governments-and-5-companies-enemies-internet). This was not the group's first foray into bitcoin tracking; when they were hacked themselves in 2015, it was discovered that the Egyptian and Saudi governments had emailed support questions about a '[Money Module](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/hacking-team-broke-bitcoin-secrecy-by-targeting-crucial-wallet-file/)' in their Remote Control System (RCS) suite. Alberto Ornaghi claimed the tool could get the following data from user wallets:

> the information we can get are: addressbook (list of all contacts and local accounts of the target), files (the wallet itself, containing the money and spend it for private keys), transactions (transaction history in/out of the target , useful for making correlations).

While it is not publicly known what the capabilities of Neutrino's XFlow nSight and nSpect products are, you could say that this news of a potential partnership with the DEA represents a "full circle." In the same email from 2014, Ornaghi included this question:

> we can also make a bitcoin transaction to buy drugs and see in the form of correlation to those who got that money **(DEA: anyone interested? :P)**

## June 5th

[**The Block**](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/67551/coinbase-irs-dea-analytics-neutrino) managing editor [Michael McSweeney](https://twitter.com/mpmcsweeney) published an article which pointed to documents in two U.S. federal contracting and grant-making databases, [System for Award Management (SAM)](https://archive.is/h8pIT) and [GovTribe](https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/coinbase-analytics-web-subscription-5000090561). They showed that "the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intend to buy licenses from Coinbase for an analytics platform called Coinbase Analytics."

In the case of [the DEA application](http://web.archive.org/web/20200611002635/https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/dealsj-0006-limitedsourcedocumentationcoinbase.pdf), which has been substantially redacted, it is claimed that Coinbase Analytics will provide "investigators with identity attribution and de-anonymi[ze] virtual currency addresses domestically and internationally," using "the most conservative heuristics... in commercial blockchain tracing tools. This is critical in avoiding false positive during target identification." As for the IRS, it will be utilized in their Criminal Investigation (CI) Cyber Crimes Unit (CCU) for "analysis and tracking of cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains that criminals are currently using." They also note that Coinbase Analytics was 'formerly known as' Neutrino, which Coinbase [acquired in February 2019](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/neutrino_coinbase-acquisition-agreement.pdf).

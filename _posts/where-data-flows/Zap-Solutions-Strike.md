Strike is a consumer and merchant services application that allows people to make and receive Lightning payments with a bank account or debit card. While the [Zap wallet](https://zaphq.io/) is non-custodial and open-source, Strike is a custodial, regulated, and proprietary product of Zap Solutions Inc., entering public beta as of July 2nd 2020.

In his announcement of Strike, founder and CEO Jack Mallers wrote:

> With our public launch, I am unbelievably proud to announce the only requirement for most users to use Strike is your name and phone number. That is not a typo. You read that correctly. We care about you a lot. We care about Bitcoin a lot. We were not going to let regulation get in the way of Bitcoinâ€™s relationship with the world.

From time to time, we may also require you to provide further information as a condition for continued use of the Services to confirm your identity and the purpose of using our Services.

Under the 'Third Party Account' terms:

> Depending on the functions that you seek to utilize with respect to transactions associated with your Account, and Zap's risk determination, Zap may, in its sole discretion, require identity verification, screening procedures, or enhanced verification using our Third-Party Partner (" Enhanced Account Verification"). As a result, you may be required to provide our Third Party Partner with certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your **name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, photograph of your government-issued ID or other photographic proof of your identity, and information regarding your bank account**.

The list of businesses which are 'prohibited' from using Strike include "Regulated Products and Services" such as as marijuana dispensaries, pharmaceutical services, and broadly any "products and services with varying legal status on a state-by-state basis," such as adult content.

### Privacy Policy

Strike's [privacy policy](https://beta.strike.me/privacy) includes the following regarding their collection and processing of personal information. In accordance with the claim in the announcement, account creation indeed requires "information such as your **name, email address, phone number, and username**." However they also use "pixel tags / web beacons," and engage in other automated collection activities: 

> Automatic Data Collection. We may collect certain information automatically when you use the Services. This information may include your **Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, operating system or device, location information (including inferred location based off of your IP address), information about how you interact with the Services, including the frequency and duration of your activities**, and other information about how you use the Services. Information we collect may be associated with accounts and other devices.

Under the 'Verification Procedures through Third Party Providers' terms:

> You acknowledge that before you receive Services from us, you will be required to complete certain verification procedures (such as KYC and AML) through our third party service providers such as Cognito. You can access Cognito's terms of service and privacy policy at: https://privacy.cognitohq.com/.

Cognito is a customer identity and business verification service for compliance and fraud protection. In September 2019, they wrote about [how they perform identity verification without social security numbers](https://cognitohq.com/identity-verification-without-ssn/):

> By asking for as little as a name and phone number, Cognito can stitch together an identity record from powerful regulated data sources, instantaneously confirming if someone is who they say they are.

While they are not trasparent about how they do this, Cognito does admit that they screen customers of financial services companies "[against lists of high-risk individuals issued by various government agencies around the globe](https://cognitohq.com/what-is-required-to-know-your-customer/)," including Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) watchlists.

Cognito's privacy policy states that they "use service providers and other third party services to help perform essential business functions on our behalf."

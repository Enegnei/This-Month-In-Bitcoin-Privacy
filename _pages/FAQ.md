### Why moths?

I like moths, especially those that engage in mimicry, e.g. "[when one organism (the mimic) converges on phenotypic features of another (the model) because of the selective benefits of sharing such a resemblance](https://sci-hub.se/10.1086/673758)." I think mimics are a good mascot for illustrating Bitcoin privacy as I see it.

Bitcoin privacy can be about hiding or refraining from producing and sharing data about oneself, but it is also about creating ambiguity, increasing uncertainty, about the (history and future of) relationship(s) between addresses and coins. Some techniques, like Chaumian equal-input CoinJoin, have more resemblance to the zebra strategy: camouflauging into a large herd so that no individual animal can be picked out. But many, such as PayJoin, are about constructing transactions in such a way where you confuse the predator (ex. blockchain surveillance companies) about what you are. If the Bitcoin blockchain is like a history book, then the goal of Bitcoin privacy is to invite as many interpretations of the narratives it contains as possible, while still preserving integrity and immutability. The predator has the opposite goal; they want to decrease ambiguity so that they can construct 'objective' narratives about who owns which coins, accurately interpret what we do with them, and then try to make life difficult.

When I started my newsletter, I knew I needed images, but I didn't want to go with the standard Bitcoin-related media kit, like golden 'B' coins, raining Matrix code, or 'Men In Hoodies.' Somehow I got the idea to input a photo of a moth with eyespots into a Google reverse image search, which returns similar-looking pictures. The results to my query were mostly human faces, and I found it hilarious that the moth's defense strategy had worked against an image recognition AI (for now). That moth was featured in [my first newsletter](https://enegnei.github.io/This-Month-In-Bitcoin-Privacy/June_2020/).

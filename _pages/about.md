**This Month in Bitcoin Privacy** is a collection of stories and events that catch her eye, specifically relating to privacy enhancements to Bitcoin, as well as the tools or strategies that bitcoiners can use to combat threats to their privacy and protect their right to [informational self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_self-determination).

For general resources, check out my beginners' presentation "[Bitcoin Privacy: On- and Off-Chain](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/slides-final-2.pdf)" (2019).

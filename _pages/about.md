**This Month in Bitcoin Privacy** (TMIBP) is a newsletter about privacy-related technology developments, events, and conversations in Bitcoin that catch her eye, as well as the tools or strategies that can be used to combat threats and protect our right to [informational self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_self-determination).

For general resources, check out "[Bitcoin Privacy: On- and Off-Chain](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/slides-final-2.pdf)" (2019), "[Building Your Privacy Foundation](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/building-your-privacy-foundation.pdf)" (2021), the [Bitcoin Privacy Guide](https://bitcoinprivacy.guide/), or the [Bitcoin Privacy Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy).

This newsletter was gratefully supported by a grant from the [**Human Rights Foundation** (HRF)](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/human-rights-foundation-announces-70000-in-bitcoin-development-grants) in March 2021.
